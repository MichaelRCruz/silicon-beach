Gentlemen, I must say that if we lose everything or never will have anything, it will be work. We own that in a sense. Is it not our domain? I know there will be many people mad at me for saying some of this, but then your friend will tell you otherwise and you will be all like, ah.

If women have the collective responsibility, opportunity, or burden to bare children, then men must carry a collective responsibility, opportunity, or burden to work. If men cannot bare children and children can work, then women can work too. Of these three, in the realm of working, do you believe should have a choice to work or not work. Men are the only third that must. It is written. When was it ever a good idea to know the pay of someone else? What happens every time? It is not easy to resist temptation to know nor is it easy to avoid the convulsion of politics and business.

What would happen if the government took a glance at the economy, made a decision, and doubled the pay for every man, gave women and teenagers the choice to work? For those, not married, would benefit from half the salary of the cumulative total of all the men in that economy in addition to the choice to work. What if you had a system that played that game for every entitlement we could imagine? How can we possibly indemnify all groups with claim and statistic? A possible response to these sorts of politics is usually undesirable. What if gender was removed from all public concepts of identity. Why are the most common questions on all government form difficult to answer? What does that say about the data they use to make their decisions?

What is the difference between reparations and indemnification? Will a new opportunity with bonus ever be sufficient for either? What if the desire to try reveled the need to think more carefully about money. How many people truly understand what is going on here with all the money? What were we taught about interest? What have we learned from it? Why keep doing the thing? Do many of you love it that much? If we do not teach your children about money in public school, is it because we actually know nothing about it? What if another reason is that it would require an adult to teach them, but how would you feel if that adult was described as someone that knew money really well? Would you want your child around that person? Why does the thought of mixing children and people that know money a creepy thought? A better question is this. If we get weirded-out about that, then why do you make money an axis?
