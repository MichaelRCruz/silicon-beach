# preface

Some of these essays will be abstracted from the diary I kept throughout my travels in the United States during the global pandemic of 2020. The method I hope to share these drafts with you are brought to you via GitHub, my current sponsor. They were there for my work as a software engineer in Los Angeles and I hope they remain supportive in my efforts to obtain further financial support to finish this book. Before I needed to write these essays, there was a diary I kept of my travels. The laptops used to write that diary were stolen out of my bag at a Chicago train station last September in 2020.

There were tears of everything pouring down when I woke up to find those two computers gone. For an awfully long and terrifying moment, actual fear struck in that underground station near Wicker Park below Division Street, but something unexpected came over my emotions. It was as if nothing else mattered in that moment. Not even that lost diary mattered. Not even the two Unix file systems that contained every original file containing every piece of software and and every line of code I ever wrote. The potential identity theft did not matter. Nothing else mattered.

In the words of Bob Dylan, "You lose yourself, you reappear. You suddenly find you got nothing to fear. Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you"

In the words of myself. "Just tell her, dude. Just go and tell her, Michael. Please, just tell her. You have to. Just go up there and tell her. She has to know. You have to do this. Just go!" Those thoughts eventually became my own voice, out-loud, as I paced back and forth crying in despair.

Finally, Chicago sent enough trains down the Blue Line to snap me out of that hypnotic misery, but still. Who was she? Was there someone out there experiencing as much pain I was in that night? Was she, too, longing for a complete unknown? Was she also suffering from this awful despair of mysterious origin? Was she just as heart-broken? Were those her prayers I was hearing? Could she hear mine? The strength of that emotion brought an end to all travels, finished my walkabout, and brought my odysee to its final chapter.

I know you were there with me since the day I left Los Angeles for that trip on October 31st, 2019. Your winds shook my car as I traveled over those mountaintops on my way through the wildfires of California. Your illusion of presence caught my eye as I searched for that river in the depths of the Grand Canyon. Your beauty in the mountains of Colorado refused to let me go as desired another look at your shapes along the stretch of interstate 90. The colors of your sunrise in the fields of Nebraska brought me tears of excitement as I sped along those dirt roads through the midwest. Your calling over the thunder and trains of Chicago now have my attention and brought me comfort in my moment of total despair.

If you are reading this, know that I received your message, but I may have forgotten what you look like, the way you smell, and the color of your hair. Know that I am still stranded outside of California and writing all this to you from a rooming house that once stood as a mansion in the neighborhood of Walkers Point on the western shore of a Great Lake in the city I grew up as a child located approximately ninety miles east of that isthmus where I went to college and learned how to sail.
