# preface

The laptop I used to draft most of my diary, _las-noticias_, was stolen out of my bag at a train station in September 2020. There were tears of everything pouring down when I woke up to find that laptop gone. For an awful moment, void of companionship and love, I paced that underground train station of Chicago in Wicker Park not knowing what to do or where to go next. Repeatedly, my heart kept saying, "just tell her, dude. Stop messing around and just tell her. Please, Michael. Just tell her". Those thoughts eventually became a whisper and that whisper eventually became my own voice until that voice, my own voice, was encouraging me to tell someone something, but who was I supposed to _tell_? What was I supposed to tell her? How was I supposed to tell her? 

Fortunately, I was able to recover my diary from an online repository and continue my travels, but still, who was she? Was there someone out there experiencing as much pain I was in that night? Was she, too, longing for an unknown love? Was she also suffering from this awful despair of mysterious origin? Was she just as heart-broken that night as I was? Were those her prayers I was hearing? Did she hear mine? Do we have a messenger? Is that you, God?

Some of these essays will be abstracted from the diary I kept throughout my travels in the United States during the global pandemic of 2020. The method I hope to share these drafts are via my current _sponsor_, Github. They were there for my work as a software engineer in Los Angeles and I hope they remain supportive in my efforts to obtain further financial support to finish this project.
