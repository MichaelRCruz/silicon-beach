## The Ask

If the painting could ask for a feeling calling you to reflect the lights beyond the moments of nostalgia during the yearly moments before death, then there is a landscape painting of five three-dimensional objects like the one I drew one day when I used my imagination. The depth of this painting, in presentation of my own, have similarities discussed in this essay.

Human intervention will appear antagonistic, like the moon, if you are not careful suggesting there is a heavenly presentation of two and the worldly appeal of choice. This deterministic luxuries of choice are evidenced by the human _condition_ that is more appropriately described as a human _process_. These words are tasked to reveal a more suitable perspective of life. In light of the contrast between the definitive human _process_ to the definitive human _condition_, I hope this hypothetical lesson pleases God. Our faith handles the rest. The _locations_ of similar interest of the elements on Earth appear to the result of intent rather than entropy.

The orchestra of the human endeavor is painted from the first chairs of silicon and carbon. They are also painted in a painting.

## The Foreground

The presence of the objects in the painting have a peculiar effect on the trees from the human perspective. Similar to a surveying stone a tree serves as a landmark along the river. The surveying stone has grown into the earth like the tree. The tree, unlike the stone on the opposing shore, does not vanish from gravity.

Perhaps this is the reason for the presence of the two objects of similar form. They do not grow like the tree and the rock on the other shore of the river and appear to help the tree mark a land as location.

Do the two objects reveal an insufficiency of the tree by virtue of the role of the objects. If not, then are the identical roles of the tree and the objects better understood in perspective of comparative form. To that end, consider the symbiotic relationship of the trees and the objects. If the inanimate objects assist the trees by _amplifying_ the message detailing a location. Technically, the trees use computers if the objects of the painting contribute to the amplified message.

The objects of like form also provide utility to the river The sophistication of them is exemplified by their paired state as the two, with a distance, can represent two points in space connected by a line. If the river is a line, then the paired state of the objects suggest that they complete the first step in the process of form. The important realization is that they have completed this step as a pair and are inanimate.

If you look close enough, the objects have an **illusion of form** personified by he two objects standing guard of a door lock. They are identified by the _form_ of the object. According to its silhouette, the form is projected on to the ground by light as shadow. The shadow is curved. Without the presence of shadow, the projection of the object must exist some place else/ Your imagination allows for the recognition of the curve that describes the form. If both projections are available in nature, by shadow and by imagination, then there is always a **preference of perception**. Contrast the two: form from shadow or form from imagination.

The objects of like form resemble the human artist that spun them on a potting wheel. Is the utility of the tree or the illusions of the objects greater than the comparison? If reason is gained from inference and inference is gained from **comparison of relativity** and the comparison of relativity requires illusions of form to reason, then is reason deluded?

## The Background

Orientation arrives to its origin as echoes in the mountains from the songs of angels singing a duet at the same space & at the same moment. This light in your imagination shines a premonition into your ears when you are lost. When you are art, the light shines a premonition. Are premonitions the perspective of relativity. Does Albert Einstein have a corresponding _other_ like Issac Newton & Gottfried Leibniz prior to their discoveries of the derivative & the integral.

If the moon were singing for you because you lost your phone, then I feel you. Giant boyfriend though he learned these optical illusions from father time, but he might not exist. The dark side of the moon & the light side of the moon are the first two optical illusions. The third is the shadow of your sail on the sea. When your eyes follow the depths of the lines of the perspective of distance, the seams are carefully lined like lipstick. The stone & the water. The object & the water, and the people & the shadow.

##### Summary

The curves of the painting sing. The song is a reflection of human sophistication. The melody emotes a feeling of love and grace. If nostalgia is not felt, then timeless is an emotion that tells the truth told by omission. The painting has no lights of electricity. That is it.
