# The Painting

## The Images

## The Thought

Would you rather answer the telephone to hang on a moment or would you rather listen to an orchestra, and the easels, and the cellos, and the little birds that told me about this girl, and about this room, and about these Nick Drake records I found that makes me want to marry her.

## The Paintings

If you are not careful, intervention will appear antagonistic. To say this is to hope my lessons please God. I will then say there are two paintings. The paintings brought me to the sky of stone and clouds in search of a door. The other side was an empty room with a view, but why did I prefer to draw from my imagination rather than draw what they asked of me? For myself, it was as if there was potential disappointment. What does it mean to disappoint somebody? I feel like the avoidance of disappointment is a very peculiar temptation.

Could we argue against that consideration since disappointment could come at the cost of a forgotten jacket. If your date had something nice planned, but your efforts were not her own, then is there disappointment? Is that not syncopation instead?

Perhaps it was the fear of disappointing myself because I did not look good enough. If beauty is seen with our eyes, then what is music? If I were to say rather that beauty is in the mind of the beholder, then what is a beholder? My ultimate concern is missing the truth. Was the truth maintained with that drawing in that therapy session? What was that flash of emptiness? The psychologist asked me to draw exactly what I saw when I opened the door, but the empty room was like a canvas.

## The Return

Functional programming does this thing where it can build a castle. Imagine a concierge desk on the ground floor of a hotel. That is the parent process responsible for all other subprocesses and just how they manage things at this hotel. Imagine the desk in your hotel room. The application is building a hotel, but each of those desks, including your own, renders as a concierge desk too. This process continues until the signal. A computer does this without concern for the physical space needed for this kind of hotel on Earth.

Think of being a hotel guest sitting at one of those desk. They did not have to bring the bed with them. The desk was also there when you arrived. To understand _statefulness_ just understand what it is like to be too full to do anything because you ate too much. You desire so few things that you do not even want to replicate. This means that all the home pages of the websites you visit at are all too full to fuck. Maybe that is why nobody gives a fuck about anybody. What is the state we consume? Is it only food that fills you up? Maybe that is why hotel rooms have complementaries. Its just that simple.

Maybe there really are angels in the architecture. The one was drawn as a boy. The other is admired as a man.

### The Foregrounds of Both

The presence of the objects in the painting have a peculiar effect on the trees from the human perspective. Similar to a surveying stone a tree serves as a landmark along the river. The surveying stone has grown into the earth like the tree. The tree, unlike the stone on the opposing shore, does not vanish from gravity.

Perhaps this is the reason for the presence of the two objects of similar form. They do not grow like the tree and the rock on the other shore of the river and appear to help the tree mark a land as location.

Do the two objects reveal an insufficiency of the tree by virtue of the role of the objects. If not, then are the identical roles of the tree and the objects better understood in perspective of comparative form. To that end, consider the symbiotic relationship of the trees and the objects. If the inanimate objects assist the trees by _amplifying_ the message detailing a location. Technically, the trees use computers if the objects of the painting contribute to the amplified message.

The objects of like form also provide utility to the river The sophistication of them is exemplified by their paired state as the two, with a distance, can represent two points in space connected by a line. If the river is a line, then the paired state of the objects suggest that they complete the first step in the process of form. The important realization is that they have completed this step as a pair and are inanimate.

If you look close enough, the objects have an **illusion of form** personified by he two objects standing guard of a door lock. They are identified by the _form_ of the object. According to its silhouette, the form is projected on to the ground by light as shadow. The shadow is curved. Without the presence of shadow, the projection of the object must exist some place else/ Your imagination allows for the recognition of the curve that describes the form. If both projections are available in nature, by shadow and by imagination, then there is always a **preference of perception**. Contrast the two: form from shadow or form from imagination.

The objects of like form resemble the human artist that spun them on a potting wheel. Is the utility of the tree or the illusions of the objects greater than the comparison? If reason is gained from inference and inference is gained from **comparison of relativity** and the comparison of relativity requires illusions of form to reason, then is reason deluded?

### The Backgrounds of Both

Orientation arrives to its origin as echoes in the mountains from the songs of angels singing a duet at the same space & at the same moment. This light in your imagination shines a premonition into your ears when you are lost. When you are art, the light shines a premonition. Are premonitions the perspective of relativity. Does Albert Einstein have a corresponding _other_ like Issac Newton & Gottfried Leibniz prior to their discoveries of the derivative & the integral.

## Summary

If nostalgia is not felt, then timeless is a word that tells the truth untold by omission.
