## The Preface

If the painting could ask for a feeling calling you to reflect the lights beyond the moments of nostalgia during the yearly moments before death, then there is a landscape painting of five three-dimensional objects like the one I drew one day when I used my imagination. The depth of this painting, in presentation of my own, have similarities discussed in this essay.

Human intervention will appear antagonistic, like the moon, if you are not careful suggesting there is a heavenly presentation of two and the worldly appeal of choice. This deterministic luxuries of choice are evidenced by the human _condition_ that is more appropriately described as a human _process_. These words are tasked to reveal a more suitable perspective of life. In light of the contrast between the definitive human _process_ to the definitive human _condition_, I hope this hypothetical lesson pleases God. Our faith handles the rest. The _locations_ of similar interest of the elements on Earth appear to the result of intent rather than entropy.

The orchestra of the human endeavor is painted from the first chairs of silicon and carbon. They are also painted in a painting.

The presence of the objects in the painting have a peculiar effect on the trees from the human perspective. Similar to a surveying stone a tree serves as a landmark along the river. The surveying stone has grown into the earth like the tree. The tree, unlike the stone on the opposing shore, does not vanish from gravity.

Perhaps this is the reason for the presence of the two objects of similar form. They do not grow like the tree and the rock on the other shore of the river and appear to help the tree mark a land as location.

Do the two objects reveal an insufficiency of the tree by virtue of the role of the objects. If not, then are the identical roles of the tree and the objects better understood in perspective of comparative form. To that end, consider the symbiotic relationship of the trees and the objects. If the inanimate objects assist the trees by _amplifying_ the message detailing a location. Technically, the trees use computers if the objects of the painting contribute to the amplified message.

The objects of identical form also provide utility to the river The sophistication of them is exemplified by their paired state as the two, with a distance, can represent two points in space connected by a line. If the river is a line, then the paired state of the objects suggest that they complete the first step in the process of form. The important realization is that they have completed this step as a pair and are inanimate.

If you look close enough, the objects have an illusion of form personified by he two objects standing guard of a door lock. They are identified by the form of the object. According to its silhouette, the form is projected on to the ground by light as shadow. The shadow is curved. Without the presence of shadow, the projection of the object in imagination allow the recognition of the curve that characterizes the form. If both projections are available in nature, then there is always a preference of perception. The objects of identical form resemble the human artist that spun them on a potting wheel.

Is the curved object, resembling the human body more practical to the natural landmark of the tree? Is practicality defined with enough reason with the presence of illusion of form? Is any reason without illusion? The curves of the painting sing. The song they sing is a reflection of human sophistication. The melodies in their song emote feelings of love and grace.

## The Background

Orientation has echoes in the moutains from the songs of amgeles singing a duet in the same space & in the same moment. The light shines a premonition when you are lost. When you are art, the light shines a perspective of relativety & shines a perspective of location. If the perspectives of light relative to the other natural phenomonons like gravity & like sound. Would a mountain be a space of perspecive if the foothills across the river could amplify a song over the mountain wall? The songs of angeles would be echoed by stone and valleys. What would this echo sound like in your rocky space of perspective? What if the echo could be identified even inside an opposing space to the foreground of the painting. If two angels sing a song in the same moment, then the artistic identity of man would be a message across a river and over the walls in the mountains slaying ears to hear distinction in sound during another moment in space.



The colors in perspective, by illumination in light, give presentation to three optical illusions. The first two are opositoinal forms and shapes in illuminaiton from a horizontal light source. The dark side of the moon & the light side of the moon are the first two optical illusions. The third is shadow. If the moon were singing for you under that tree and on your sailboat because you cannot listen to music on your phone, then I got you, but check this out. The moon only has one of its optical illusions exposed to us because it is, supposedly, locked in orbit. If that is true, then I have shown two things that I have learned today. First, the moon is an emodiment of worldly illusion. Second, if giant boyfriend was only showing one of his optical illuisions, does that mean he is hiding the only way he knows how or since he does not use the other two optical illusions of mother nature and father time, he then should be considered efficient since the other two domains just need to wake up. When your eyes follow the depths of the lines of the perspective of distance, the seams are carefully lined like lipstick. The stone against the water and itself, the object and the water, the woman and the shadow, and the Earth and the sky.

The color of the leaves suggest more about location. If this is true then the message is further amplified by the tree. Adfditionally, the nature of the leaves, compared to the snow on top of the mountainis in the backgroud suggest a worldly proximatey often found in an arid climate. Since the color of the leaves suggest this, then the scope must be dialwed out if there is a desire to continue. The color of the leaves, in their shared color scheme within that space of the painting, speaks of a moment much more sacred than any found with nostalgia. If nostalgia was not the right word if the moment was not now, then what word? Timeless.
