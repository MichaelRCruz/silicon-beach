I can tell you everything about the baseball game in front of us, but that still leaves you suspicious of my score card.

Have you ever wondered how we become attached to moments that feel like they belong to you and also feel like you belong to them? How does that happen? It is not often that I find myself asking where that came from, but for myself, the human condition is one of them. It's just a topic of interest and, for others, a hobby.

Someone wrote an article once, but the headline was enough. That interest became one thanks to another. How can we thank each other for this? Can we even do this with trust anymore? The situation we're in is difficult because we built a society around something new. It's easy to forget how quickly it has accommodated the stuff it is good at accommodating, but c'mon. How is grandma supposed to know when an "upper decker" is if she can't look it up?

The challenge, for myself, is communicating to how dynamic the series of inconveniences have been on my screen. For you or the reader, it may have been different. When we remember the _actual_ newspaper, you are confident that each an every person was able to read the same article and, more importantly, the same set of articles. We were all exposed to the same advertisements. That was the built-in accountability for marketers. These days, if I told you I was "funneled" into a shit ass meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, and crew, would you believe me? Would you immediately blame Mark for it? Would you consider that it might have been the plan of someone else? How would you explain this to grandma that cannot look up "upper decker"? What if grandma was the same age as the current POTUS? Would you be concerned?

People remember what they like, but what if someone had a list of what you liked? What if that person also had a way to scatter breadcrumbs to show you a path and those crumbs were your topics of interest? Where would you go online? Where are you online now? What if your child was singled out online and they had basically zero chance of finding what they were looking for? What if you child was smart enough to still find these topics of interest, but became so exhausted from the intended sabotage of intent, that they grew angry and disinterested in everything?

What if the government could share their ideas with you and you did not know it was them? Remember watching baseball on any of their iOS apps? This may be true for other platforms as well, but behind the batting box there were ads on the wall just under those front-row seats? There will be no way for me to confirm this or maybe I did not try hard enough, but what if those ads were computer generated? It seems like a strange concept, but the technology is capable and money makes it practical. The subterfuge is this - at the ballpark, they are still real.

Abstract this out to all other things markets can do. In other words, pretend to be a marketer. What kind of innovative things would you do to impress your boss if your colleague was already staging a computer aided advertising campaign like that. Imagine fresh out of college and finding yourself in an industry that has neglected to adopt new moral standards for these new practices?

You are now in a dystopian world. You all still have masks on. Your government has lied to you. They have an incentive, more so than ever before, to do so. Please, from the bottom of my heart, know that my experience since January of 2020 has been nothing short of escaping death. I will try to articulate these experiences of mine to convince you of this.

Once you begin to understand how dangerous the internet and technology has become, then I hope you will start to see them in real life. This includes the way we exchange money, the way we use telecommunication systems in the United States, the way we identify ourselves and authenticate to each other in person and everything else I can prioritize for you.

Lastly, please know where I am located. It is a city about 90 miles north of Chicago on the western shore of Lake Michigan. Northwestern Mutual, Johnson Controls, Harley Davidson are all located here. The neighborhood is called Walker's Point. This is a small art district just south of downtown. Next to my building is an old mansion that has been around since the late 1800s. The property owners have identified themselves as Fifth Street Investments, LLC and the property owners of the building next door that is to be _included_ in the same group of rooming houses is called Walker's Point Mansion. There is a restaurant down the street called Hamburger Marys and another, in the other direction, called FUEL Cafe. Lastly, they just changed the name of the ballpark here from Miller Park to American Family Field.
