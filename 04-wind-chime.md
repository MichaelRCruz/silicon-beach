I can tell you everything about the baseball game in front of us, but that still leaves you suspicious of my score card.

Have you ever wondered how we become attached to moments that feel like they belong to you and also feel like you belong to them? How does that happen? It is not often that I find myself asking where that came from, but for myself, the human condition is one of them. It's just a topic of interest and, for others, a hobby.

Someone wrote an article once, but the headline was enough. That interest became one thanks to another. How can we thank each other for this? Can we even do this with trust anymore? The situation we're in is difficult because we built a society around something new. It's easy to forget how quickly it has accommodated the stuff it is good at accommodating, but c'mon. How is grandma supposed to know when an "upper decker" is if she can't look it up?

The challenge, for myself, is communicating to how dynamic the series of inconveniences have been on my screen. For you or the reader, it may have been different. When we remember the _actual_ newspaper, you are confident that each an every person was able to read the same article and, more importantly, the same set of articles. We were all exposed to the same advertisements. That was the built-in accountability for marketers. These days, if I you you I was "funneled" into a shit ass meeting with Mark Zuckerberg, and crew, would you believe me? Would you immediately blame Mark for it? Would you consider that it might have been the plan of someone else? How would you explain this to grandma that cannot look up "upper decker"? What if grandma was the same age as the current POTUS? Would you be concerned?

People remember what they like, but what if someone had a list of what you liked? What if that person also had a way to scatter breadcrumbs to show you a path and those crumbs were your topics of interest? Where would you go online? Where are you online now? What if your child was singled out online and they had basically zero chance of finding what they were looking for? What if you child was smart enough to still find these topics of interest, but became so exhausted from the intended sabotage of intent, that they grew angry and disinterested in everything?

What if the government could share their ideas with you and you did not know it was them?


If the human condition was something that you loved, would you fight? If not, where would you run? What if the human condition had a third option besides fight or flight?
