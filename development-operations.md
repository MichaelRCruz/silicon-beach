# Development Operations

Those days in the library in Madison, when they were still expected to be open for moments like this one, I remembered almost all online services have a public application programming interface. The United States Postal Service has one too. They email me a _phoyocopy_ of the letters I am supposed to receive that day. Without any JavaScript Object Notation, an email arrived with, not only a list of my mail, but also a list of all the other people living in that house on McConnell.

You cannot convince me that the condo I was living in was not sold illegally. I was able to get a date with the real estate agent, but I cannot remember the movie. You would have to ask her. We got a drink after and then I drove home in my black Subaru Imprezza before the roof racks. Either way, I had to go because something was waiting for me at the Grand Canyon. You know, the moment I first cried. The moment I was happy alone without anyone.

Skipping over the road trip brought me to Madison on one of the coldest winters I can remember, but the best way to start this story is IntelliJ IDEA because there is a terminal tucked in there and some angel set me up to limit all http requests to that application or so a notification said. Nnnno matter the source, I had confidence again in my computer.

One afternoon in the library.
