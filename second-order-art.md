# Second Order Art

## Objective

In search of The _Second Order Art_.

## I Can't Even

0. It's so beautiful.

1. Just listen. Pretend you fully understand the measurement that you might observe from literally anything. To slice it into only two abstractions is a luxury of choice. Your space is divided evenly or or unevenly, but to have consideration for nothing requires division. This should support their theories of discreet math and the like.

2. Maybe the reason is not that you cannot divide by zero, but rather you _have_ to divide. Maybe divided-by-zero is actually a shitty band name.

3. A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds.

4. Like a wanning moon returning light approaching zero or the waxing light approaches one?

5. In make-believe michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him.

6. He is so far away.

7. He is big enough that it is comfortable to observe the entire history of the universe.

8. In one stream inside a human box office, lol.

9. He lives forever so time means nothing to him.

10. However, if you really think about it.

11. If his eyes were good enough, your giant boyfriend could see everything that ever happened in history.

12. Here is the part that scares everyone.

13. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with your digital video recaller.

14. The boyfriend giant watches nature all day when you are at work,

15. At night _the boyfriend giant_ uses the stars or the moon to navigate by any means necessary.

16. If you were to ask me if it was worth it, I would say for our sake yes, but just-in-case remember that we designed our existence on the premise that we cannot change the past. Imagine a world with no history.

17. Imagine a world with no future.

18. We could discuss this, forever. Before we hang up, check this out.

19. Who?

. . .

0. Hello!

1. Wait, you're not moving.

2. Are you there?

3. Can you see me now?

4. Yeah...can see you?

5. What's going on?

6. Alright. Are you there? Check this out...

7. Yeah.

8. One day, I closed my eyes and found these five three-dimensional boxes. They were just floating there.

9. Are you there?

10. Maybe it was that time when I was a kid with the psychologist,

11. Was it that story prompt he gave you?

12. Yeah, it loops recursively, or at least does now, lol.

13. Those cubes?

14. Yeah, I drew them on paper. Remember that empty room I first opened?

15. Was it the one you had to live in?

16. What? No. These rooms are just for these angels to have a place to gather. I don't know.

17. That sounds incredible, remember Wind Waker on Game Cube?

18. I know.

19. but

20. Check this out though. That same day, it occurred to me that these empty spaces in my heart were not really locked.

21. how

22. I thought to myself. That is when they these angels just started showing up.

23. Check _this_ out, though. Guess what else showed up for you?

24. My folders and notebooks from college?

25. Can you believe I saved every _single_ one for you?

26. Yeah, that is beyond me. Considering my current occupation, I might need to just get home from work. Gotta go.

27. Since you are floating on deep water, think about how fucking deep it really is?

28. The waters of the sea are so deep that there is no sunlight.

29. Why does the light stop? Does this imply that the frictionless environments, like space, may not exist?

30. What if they do, but the elements that light shines through have this effect of enhancing its course throughout the galaxy.

31. The elements of nature are moved by entropy.

32. If everything started with a bang, then what does the curvature of light look like?

33. How could your calculator graph this.

34. How could you graph this if a moment could be observed twice?

35. Could boyfriend giant write software to process that film?

36. It does not seem easy, but it should be.

37. You will have to consider the correct depth.

38. There is a telescope that allows myself to see the surface of these cute sunsets on the horizon.

39. In make-believe michaelville, they are exploratory spaces just like snacks.

40. If she is out there, on the water, maybe in irons like I was, then I will let her use my telescope even if that means making one with your 3D printer.

41. This is my telescope. There are many like it and all of them are mine.

42. Check this out. Imagine fifty-two playing cards.

43. First imagine an electronic letter sent to my inbox. That is where you will find that special value.

44. I very much want to decide on my occupation, but that does not matter because I am unaware of the list of priorities you have running in time.

45. So, what?

46. There was something I noticed in the light the other day that I need to tell her and the reader about.

47. Yeah

48. For me, purple light is slower in speed comparatively speaking to the other hues or colors or whatever.

49. I noticed it twice with my eyes.

50. It reminded me of this pen-pal from childhood. The letter was delivered with a picture of them.

51. Did something weird happened that day at recess?

52. I sat on the playground, with my back resting against the wall, and wondered what was happening with my eyes.

53. Was that photograph stereoscopic.

54. Maybe. My pen-pal was wearing this combination of blue and red, but the tie was floating into some other dimension.

55. Maybe it was finally at its destination.

56. Does this mean ultra violet light needs a closer look?

57. Is stereoscopic vision easier to obtain than it sounds?

58. That is what it is, basically.

## The Simplest Form

### The First Dimension

If you think about it, a point in space, or a point in the air, or some point on a painters canvas is difficult to imagine. The artist will never _truly_ rpresent this kind of point. You could stand a still as possible, facing your easel, but nothing could represent a point. You will have to use your imagination. Scientists, engineers, artists, and math people have to do this every day for their job.

Picture one. Try to imagine, maybe, a reference point. _Location_ might be more descriptive here. The other interesting part is that this point is not conceivable unless you have a pair. My point is that a location is interesting, but makes no sense in this thought experiment.

### The Second Dimension

Figure 1

```

Start with a pair of locations, then, or points in space. For this second part, though, connect the two with a straight line. For demonstration purposes, please make sure the line is perfectly straight, or taut.

Make a copy of the previous figure, but use your imagination to connect them together depicted in the next figure. Try to resemble two sets of parallel lines that create four points of intersection, `@`.

Follow the pattern through this next position in an effort to resemble a cube. The pattern is duplication of the lower-order dimension. The pattern then draws lines of division to each corresponding vertice. Duplication & contact, duplication & contact, duplication & contact, and then the figure of form.

If you are careful, figure 3 illustrates something interesting. It is not mathematically profound nor does it add to the knowledgebase of any scientific discipline. For myself, this exercise introduced me to time. For now, that allowed me to consider the order those positions will have paired with the other processing pattern. This next processing pattern was conceived using the comparison of a two kinds of shapes and the properties of the dimensions described into position.

## Something Something Baseball

If you take all the hits ever in every game of baseball, then you could have a histogram of the travel distances and that will reveal the upper and lower limit of integration. Removing gravity would be some cool art if you could show that with a sphere inside a cube. If paper could be folded into a sphere and folded into a cube could be folded into a three-sided pyramid. then the art project could also have a challenge.

The challenge is to start with one wooden block, then when the medium is reduced without losing complication you carve away at the cube until it is a sphere. The next shape to reduce the finite amount of medium you removed from that space. Some more _negative_ space is added when the craving maintains the same level of sophistication, but now it is a three-sided pyramid. The next order would start with the cube again, but the cube is now in the second order of distinction.

You could make an elephant, but what if all the elephants were required to have all flat sides. Technically, all the sides would need to satisfy the requirements that meet the definition of a mathematical plane. Would a three-sided pyramid be the simplest shape that was not in the family of shapes that was not already there? This representation, of three components, would have registered to vote with the same things in science that vote in a state where the citizens are sets. These sets appear to change form in a process. The next component you could carve out of the three-sided pyramid starts the next loop with the cube again. Is this a process, then, by definition?

Superimpose the sphere, cube, and triangle, one of each and each the same height. This should illustrate the space, the surface, and the vantage point that are the cube, the triangle, and the sphere respectively.

The cubed space allows for no input resembling the walls of logical systems, but movement is allowed and all the known laws of physics apply.

The three-sided pyramid and, its base, allow no input. The laws of physics inside the pyramid are irrelevant because the three sides represent three boundaries that serve this system as a set of boundaries. The base of the pyramid will be subtracted from any value that attempts to be the total surface area of the space. If possible, the same would go for the six points of the sphere that scratch the inner surface of the cube.

To visualize the space, and the only that can have a volume, superimpose only the three-sided pyramid and the cube. If you superimpose the sphere, then that new surface that appears is the plane that contains the _vantage points_.

With these three categories of surfaces, the ballplayers are crushing these baseballs off the surface of the three-surfaced pyramid. I mean, technically, there are ball players that crush them off the base of the pyramid, but all the game stats for every game on that base are meaningless. There is no space in between the base and the sixth side of the cube.

Sides five, four, three, two, and one of the cube, when unfolded, is the total math plane of the upper something, not sure yet. The lower something not sure yet is the sum total planes of the unfolded pyramid.

You are allowed to cut along the paper you may have imagined, but just pretend each surface was a piece of glass held together at the seems with glue. Only the cube and the three-sided pyramid have a hinge. The hinge for the cube is one of the seams of the sixth plane. The base of the three-sided pyramid has a hinge as well. The base of the three-sided pyramid is a double paned window of glass because of the sixth plane.

As these baseball players are crushing these baseballs off the surface of planet pyramid, you are recording the distances of travel each baseball would make, but along the surface of origin. As each hit is recorded, the distance traveled is thrown into the function on the scoreboard and the value is calculated. This must be true for the first hit of opening day and the last hit of the series.

The graphic we want is one that looks like the Cartessian Coordinate System, but only the first quadrant. The point of rest, for each ball traveled, is the point where the ball first touches the ground. That point of second contact corresponds with the point of first contact that might be where the ball touches the bat. How will we account for this?

What if the desire was to remove all effects gravity and air resistance could have on the ball? Imagine a slugger that could spin around so fast as to create a second point of contact? Since that is theoretically possible on Earth, then that must be allowed. If two contact points exist, then those two points can connect a straight line. Those lines might be important, but how could we not pretend and say each baseball player was racing their ghost and that justified the inclusion of the second point of contact for the baseball. Do we have statistics on the global positioning satellite information that records the origin and destination of each distance traveled? Good.

To justify the global origin not existing on the one of the planes of the three-sided pyramid, consider that a possible representation of entropy. If the delivery of the pitch is calculated human effort, then the offensive move of the pitcher becomes the entropy that allows the baseball to leave the surface of the bat. Is the pitching team the offense? Would the soldiers that battle entropy be on the offense only Earth or is their pitcher throwing a no-no? What if it was giant boyfriend? If so, was that the only game that giant boyfriend pitched a no-no in?

Since you can still hit the ball, those are technically not hits, but what about foul balls? Should we include those? The purpose of this question is to provide context for the sentiment of catching a foul ball. As a kid, if you caught one, would you keep it. If we wrote a table of the four types of hits, or foul balls, or home _runs_, we could never decide. Have you ever watched a ball come back the other way like someone throwing an opposing team home _run_ back where it came from? This should help us decide the classification we need to select the data set.

There are two pairs of moments that have significance throughout all the baseball games ever scored. The first pair has one that occurred somewhere in the nine innings that introduced commercials into the game. The second pair of moments is the moment before the first hit on the first game of the first baseball season of the game that introduced the pitching clock. The corresponding moment of both pairs has not occurred yet.

These were chosen because they are the only two I can think of that had the most influence on the pace of the game. The suggestion I am making is that the concept of time into the game of baseball had an effect on the entropy and that opposing force in our model. The entropy here is the hit off any pitch and the opposing force is giant boyfriend, the pitcher. Some other essay describes my thoughts on the opposing force to human effort as entropy. If human effort requires divine intervention by nature and nature is created by God, then would opposition make sense. What if God was entropy as well? What if it was God crushing those baseballs with double contact.

A clarification from your frequently asked questions, FAQ, is regarding the rule about the a ball that hits the bat before hitting the ground. Whatever the resulting score has recorded is still valid.

If God was the ghost you were racing in the box, then the blind umpire would never even know about the second spin he put on the ball. This is the reason to remove all gravity in one of our models. The other model has gravity. Both models should have a revelation of their own, including one that has us compare the two models also too. The double hit works like this. You make contact with the ball, but God waits for the pitch as well, but the spin you first gave it has been given enough English on that cue ball to remove gravity. This last rule in this system is the disappearing of the four planes of the pyramid the moment following the second God contact and also the vantage points that make up the sphere. That is for later.
