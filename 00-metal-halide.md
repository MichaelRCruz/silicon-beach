# Metal Halide

There is a gift, but you have to find it.

It is not clear how I knew nor if there was intention for me to find it, but eventually the gift was delivered. It took time to understand the significance, but with patience the gift rendered its beauty into my imagination. The captivation and the brilliance and I knew.

There is a day in spring that has that smell in the air. It is this sweet smell with a promising effect of encouragement that I could feel in my stomach once every year. You could breathe in the air, close your eyes, smile, and exhale new hope that brings new life for the trees and those they protect. That feeling provided a sense of freedom and a new wonder for life's subsequent loops around the sun. Those smells, those breaths, and those butterflies of my youth. Those three.

There is a day when you chose seclusion that encourages a peculiar familiarity within yourself that hides and empathy is the captain of your vessel. When that abstraction of the world is fully awake inside, time adjusts you to the nature you always forget and the spirit that is always there. Your observations of that place often provide what you ask for because what you see now are the answers to your prayers. Thoughts become infinity conceivable moments of unforgettable happiness vulnerable among others. This worldly place around you is - the other way.

Imagine life, our muse, that shines its sophistication inwards like the light we shine outwards for others. The bidirectional shinning is a pair of elementary particles. They turn towards a desire for space, a place of reciprocation in vogue, balanced inside axioms of logic. The source of truth and the divine natural laws of our singularity.

One moment
is love
splicing arrays
pitching hues.
It is
two preludes
sand resolves.
Insight and
one music
box just
in-time. In
position, collapsing
into factored
parallelogram. It
frames a
position juxtaposed
within verse,
coming about,
tacking into
motion. Earth
shakes. We
awake. Our
lashes blink,
then we
see no
fear of
our complete
unknown. Incompletion
fades into
oblivion. This
is us.
Time for
new divergence
from emotional
solitude spinning
_inn_ infinity
closer two
the heart.
