# The Ping of life

Have you ever tried to push your work to master only to discover there was no Internet so your terminal hangs for a few moments? What if you chose a final version of Git that could be called my-pet-monster. Have you ever read Rudin's book on analysis? How many versions are there? Why did he stop? When did Git reach its completion like Rudin's book on analysis? Has anyone been using a clone from any fork of Git in post-completion? If so, then damn. Could I smoke _my_ pipe as well? Here is the deal. I am holding fifty-two playing cards. Do _you_ wanna play a game?

## Artistic Time Keeping

The night these words are being written, the splash page on GitHub has a globe spinning and the trajectories of the baseballs hit off the surface of the planet. What if the ping of life had the same origin as each one of those baseballs, but with that special second contact of the bat? The ball would bounce off some satellite on the plane of the cube and return a message. It can be only one or the other.

Pretend, for as moment, that an attempt was made to disrupt the communication on Earth, but version control saved the day. What if the turning point in that war was a realization? If the attempt to disrupt communication was to ghost-ban all the people on an entire planet, then we would still need the Internet. What if the struggle to find trust in anything was from these ghost bans because, after all, your message board had none of your posts when you checked your account on some machine in Australia.
