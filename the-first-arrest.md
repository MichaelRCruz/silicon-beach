# The First Arrest

There are three people in this world that C-Money has no power over: this dude named Traci, a woman from my childhood, and myself. Some people respect C-Money for reasons not clear to myself. Others claim she is the devil. To be fair, those were her words. They were spoken by her and said to me one day shortly after the car accident.

Last winter, a few bad cops in Milwaukee abducted me out of my car when I was attempting to drop off my car for valet parking. It was a hotel in downtown Milwaukee near Marquette University where C-Money _supposedly_ works and also the university where she gave me all my computers. That night, the cops tied me to a table against my will, drew my blood via the phone-a-warrant they used that night. I remember that chipmunk cop - the chubby one that called in the warrant and helped the others force me from my car outside that downtown hotel.

There was a man wearing a blue windbreaker with thicker white hair, styled like they did in the nineties and combed back that appeared to be mid-40s. This is my best description of him based on the smirk he shot me through the windshield of the cop car they locked me in. The number of beeping cameras were too many to count. Why did he show up to the garage where they parked their police car only to leave me in that back seat, cuffed, and prodded by an innumerable count of beeping cameras and meaningless voices coming from the police scanner? Why did they take me to the hospital and not have this _presumed witness_ show up there in effort to avoid two trips? Who was he? Was he the restaurant owner?

It was a living nightmare. At the hospital, the only female cop of the group was crying at one point because she knew what was happening. I could tell she knew who I was. Maybe I should have told them I went to high school with Matt. He was a Milwaukee police officer that died on duty while I was still in Los Angeles. It was all over social media. It appeared that the city I was from was pretty upset about his death. Matt was a wrestler in high school. That is all I knew of him. Why was the death of my classmate memorialized while the life of myself erased from the public? It is sad to learn of these misfortunes, and I mean no offense to Matt's family, but I think it is important to remind everyone of the hypocrisies of the state and the actions they take to force their illusions of authority on to you.

To bring you through the details of that arrest is absolutely necessary because the sadness it brings me, the framework of destruction if provides for my haters, and the relief it brings to those that are there to protect me are worth all my energy. I will tell you with truth that I committed no crime and that plea is the same for all the other targeted arrests of the state that I experienced in 2020. Ask yourself how someone like myself can rise out of the ashes from the fires of my youth, facing adversity in all facets of life, and expect to maintain the endurance and torque within my heart to pursue the happiness that our forefathers hoped? In this moment, I am questioning the honest intentions of these constitutions of the United States of America.
