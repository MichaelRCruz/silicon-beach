        <p>
            The moment

            you wonder

            what's in

            a name,

            the return

            is sound,

            by recursion

            the next

            and only

            loop around.

            Two chimes

            are facts.

            The words

            keep pace.

            To know,

            I wonder,

            what's in

            a space?
