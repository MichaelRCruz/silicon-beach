You are alone on your sailboat with no land on the horizon. That is when you remember the wall clock. The numerals once again appear on the horizon of the Earth. You are left with two celestial bodies in space, your worldly existence, and a spiritual presence that you call love. You can learn how to how to sail, but the ocean and the wind and the stars are there for everyone. That truth is real, but what if the moon and the wind was also only for you? Would you live in that moment?

For myself, the pursuit of happiness is everything all at once, but that was my struggle and my negligence. To say that _everything_ is the total conceptualization of what you know is inaccurate. What word would you use to describe your total conceptualization to include your creator? Can there be one?

One summer prior to my journey, the relentless desire to succeed by any means necessary brought me all that I could ask for. The splendor of my potential was a joy that finally arrived. For a moment in life, introspection found no intruding sadness and the frequent sense of impending doom that surfaced as a child became a fossil. I kept working to build my home on the mountain. All anxieties I felt throughout my life moved out. The vacancies of null invited no such thing to move in.

Beyond initialization, my internal process began behaving in strange and unexpected ways that did not make sense and were difficult to understand. The vacancies of null, where no such thing now lived, led to fault. Although my doors had locks on them, and were closed the moment my sadness left, there was an illusion of safety that shrouded my eyes. After the eviction of my anxieties and the arrival of no such thing, the angels of heaven had no space to occupy. Instead, at sea I was left with only my intuition and God. That summer, I built my castle on the mountain. Through closed and unlocked doors, no such thing crept in. My odyssey was the battle to reclaim my castle, but the beauty in that approach was the artistic endeavor of God.

As one moment provided for another, one process initialized the subsequent until completion. The balance of null & state & error revealed the tessellation of shapes as the lights and shadows relentlessly fought for balance while my own completeness in truth was only half found at center.

1. a presentational layer of identity
2. shapes found in architecture to guide understanding and utility of form

```javascript

const myFunc = ({pop, crackle, snap}) => ({pop, crackle, snap})(myFunc)(this.state);

. . .

const myState = this.state;

  return {pop, crackle, snap};
}
myFunc(myState);

. . .

const myState = this.state
