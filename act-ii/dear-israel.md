### Title
The Telescope

### Description

Our states are contained by two retaining walls of the sea protected by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. To our north and to our south the surveying stones of the past are often buried over time. We also observe them slowly drifting by the hands and hearts of men. The history of the world has relied on rivers or other natural landmarks to prevent this unnatural loss of information, but the natural law of entropy will always challenge these efforts. The delineations on our maps have also been drawn in our hearts and then in the minds of our children.

To live without borders is a world without fear. To live without fear is a life without God. Our explorations have scattered us to places with no explanation for where we are and what we have become. The distances between us are now immeasurable in our isolation because the lengths that span the negative space between you, myself, and the reader have now grown beyond the logistical realm of this world. These distances have penetrated the temporal vacancies of space forced between us by an army commanded by no such thing.

The revelation of our forefathers wrote words for our interpretive spirits to ask questions. The revelation of _myself_ articulates a question of posterity. Both are guided by God's declaration for a new independence on Earth. This will be a war for identity, for domain, and for artistic integrity declared by a supernatural awakening on Earth. We have been strengthened through our trials & tribulations. The fortification of our hearts seeks a love that finds resolution in God.

The world of the silicon valley of San Francisco has spread like a desert into the silicon beaches of Los Angeles, the silicon forests of Portland, and the silicon allies of New York. To be lost in this desert is to follow a mirage on the horizon where there is no water. The illusions in these digital landscapes of communication contain superficial corridors that empty into places of inescapable dimensions.
