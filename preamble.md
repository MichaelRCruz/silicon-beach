# Preamble - the Figure Eight Maneuver

Some assumptions others make of you are usually, by default, the worst. They often do that through natural contrast of thought, or the lazy inclination to dislike others, or because there is something they do not understand. This is a crime against humanity. It is an intended consequence of the battle over your soul. Each and every one of us fights these battles. The society we live in, that we call the United States, has festered. The bandages of history have been layered over the wounds of the collective mistakes all of us have made, including the world's greatest generation. It is now that we must rip these bandages off and let God heal these wounds because if you do not let him, the vacancies of null will. Lately, that has been tech. Silicon Valley has now grown like an arid desert into the silicon beaches of Los Angeles, the silicon forests of Portland, and the silicon allies of New York.

If I was the skipper, and someone went overboard, I would not ask them to swim back to the boat. There would be a figure-eight maneuver, a life-preserver to pull yourself in, and a hand if and only if requested by you. That something a teacher showed me on Lake Mendota and also the lesson that was practiced the most. Every lesson began with the figure eight maneuver, i.e., how to save a life.

If you cannot already tell, I often get lost in thought and turn towards that exercise because it is. But if you look closer, with a little effort, you will see there is never an outline or any articulated plan for my work, unless required. There is never a plan for writing, unless required, and never have I ever kept a calendar, unless required. The no-calendar thing was true in college and especially the web applications I built.
