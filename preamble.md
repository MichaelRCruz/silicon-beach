# Preamble - the Figure Eight Maneuver

Dear California,

Our country is contained by two retaining walls of the sea protected by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. To our north and to our south the surveying stones of the past are often buried over time. We also observe them slowly drifting by the hands and hearts of man. The history of the world has relied on rivers or other natural landmarks to prevent this unnatural loss of information, but the natural law of entropy will always challenge these efforts. The delineations on our maps have also been drawn in our hearts and then in the minds of our children.

To live without borders is a world without fear. To live in a world without fear is a home without God. Our explorations have scattered us to places with no explanation. The distances between us are now immeasurable in our spaces of isolation while distances in time have become a factor as the consequence to these vacancies of space forced between us by no such thing - the enemies we are chasing that cannot be defined as one word.

A person lost in the desert will find temptations to follow a mirage on the horizon where they find no water. Silicon Valley has grown like a desert into the silicon beaches of Los Angeles, the silicon forests of Portland, and the silicon allies of New York. Some of us are lost in this arid climate. The illusions we find in these landscapes seem to come from demonic places and the orchestration of no such thing is incomprehensible when considering this current chapter to be the plans of any human endeavor.

If I was the skipper of a sailboat, and someone went overboard, I would not ask them to swim back to the boat. There would be a figure-eight maneuver, a life-preserver to pull yourself in, and a hand to help if and only if you asked for one. That is something a teacher taught me on Lake Mendota. Every lesson began with that figure-eight maneuver. My prayers have been for everyone to put in the same effort as those instructors have in teaching each other how to save a life.

Some assumptions others make of you are usually, by default, the worst. They often do that through natural contrast of thought, or the lazy inclination to dislike others, or because there is something they do not understand. This is a crime against humanity. It is an intended consequence of the battle over your soul. Each and every one of us fights this battle.
