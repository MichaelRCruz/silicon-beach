Have you ever wondered how we become attached to moments that feel like they belong to you and also feel like you belong to them? How does that happen? It is not often that I find myself asking where that came from, but for myself, the human condition is one of them. Someone wrote about it, but I never read the article. I might have, but that interest in a life experience was made official when another writer figured out how to articulate those three words: the human condition. How can we thank each other for this? The interest in this subject could have faded away. It did not, but was it really that simple? People remember what they like, but what if someone else had a list of what you liked? What if that person also had a way to share these potential topics of interest with you and you were completely oblivious of that unsolicited intent? How do you feel about commercials? Have you grown used to them? If so, what would it take for you to keep up with this feed? Is it unsettling to see the other you across the way? Have you ever been excited to share something with a stranger hoping to make a friend? What if you shared an idea with three friends at dinner? What if just one person were capable to share their ideas with everyone all at once? Is there a social spectrum that some have no regard for and others enjoy? Do these thoughts make other ideas about government feel trivial? What if the government could share their ideas with you on both fronts? What if, at that point, you could never know? Would your optimism hope it was accidental? How would the pessimists feel? Could those two extremes decide? What if you were the only one that cared? What if all of us cared very much, but things never changed? What if the worst of this scale left us incapable of learning from each other? Do you see any hope? If the human condition was something that you loved, would you fight? If not, where would you run? What if the human condition had a third option besides fight or flight?
