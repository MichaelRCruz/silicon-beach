# sail

How to sail. How to write. How to draw. All three require two people and something to share, kind of like a baseball. The idea is not to drop it, but there remains an expectation, each other has about the return. There are good days and there are bad days. Bad days might be like waiting too long for the return; good days might be like not waiting at all. For all the days, though, you just can't ask for it when the ball is not in your glove. Is this the idea Cazzie David hoped the reader would see when she chose the title of her book?
