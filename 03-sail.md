# sail

How to sail. How to write. How to draw. All three require two people and something to share, like a baseball. The idea is to play catch, but the fun is to let something go with a trusting intent that returns to you a sense of admiration, validity, and spirit. These moments in life show you that you can give and receive and need not ask. The _ask_ has three letters. How inconceivable is a word like this that occupies such little space in print and so much more space in understanding. How inaccurate is that comparison of those two spaces when both directions approach infinity? If you could let baseball show you anything, then ask someone to play _catch_. Assuming that phrase is timeless, as people often do, then please remember the ask. No one wants to ask for anything, but they do. Most of us try not to, and those that try not to even though they have to, balk.

Cazzie's book has a title. Would a title name a book? Can a name title a story? Can a story be a life? Is a life untold anything lived at all?
