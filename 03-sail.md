# sail

How to sail. How to write. How to draw. All three require two people and something to share, like a baseball. The idea is to play catch, but the fun is to let something go with a trusting intent that returns to you a sense of admiration, validity, and spirit. These moments in life show you that you can give and receive and need not ask. The _ask_ has three letters. How inconceivable is a word like this that occupies such little space in print and so much more space in understanding. How inaccurate is that comparison of those two spaces when both directions approach infinity? If you could let baseball show you anything, then ask someone to play _catch_. Assuming that phrase is timeless, as people often do, then please remember the ask. No one wants to ask for anything, but they do. Most of us try not to, and those that try not to even though they have to, balk.

Cazzie David authored a book. Her book has a title. Does a title name a book? Can a name title a story? Can a story be a life? Is a _life untold_ anything lived at all? The point I hope to share with the reader is how much they can infer from the title of one's work. Casually speaking, a title means more than expected. For myself and the reader, consider how much we can learn from Cazzie's book, _No One Asked For This_.

First, consider the interface of [regular expressions](silicon-beach/regular-expression.md) found in my document, regular-expressions.md. This brute force approach does not really prove much, but the iterations attempt to explore the scope of her book's title. The conclusion I hope to share is the accuracy and balance she found in her choice of words.
