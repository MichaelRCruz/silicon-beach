# The Telescope

Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by the idea of or notion for or understanding that you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could also say that is as close as it gets. Not to be cryptic, but it is true that to consider this to be God if we have considered unfairness. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all. Still, how nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this point if it was not for literally everything thing that happened. Including the bad stuff. Someone will call this unfair too, but what if your life was not over even after death? If Christmas was not commercialized, would you remember it every year?

If you wanted to contemplate the logic of love, then try to define an action that yields a union by connecting two spots with a taut line. The lines will collect to reveal an object resembling a cube. In an effort to understand the significance of cubed properties, then run a diff on the sequence of form until the cusp of simplicity is achieved. It seems that I have found two building blocks. One for life and the other for life. These two objects build the map, do the dance, and march through an infinite oblivion.

Your telescope is fun to look at, but if you really want to know how to see, then we have to work through these thought experiments first.
