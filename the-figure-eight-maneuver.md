# The Figure Eight Maneuver - pretend preamble

Dear California,

Our country is contained by two retaining walls of the sea protected by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. To our north and to our south the surveying stones of the past are often buried over time. We also observe them slowly drifting by the hands and hearts of man. The history of the world has relied on rivers or other natural landmarks to prevent this unnatural loss of information, but the natural law of entropy will always challenge these efforts. The delineations on our maps have also been drawn in our hearts and then in the minds of our children.

To live without borders is a world without fear. To live without fear is a life without God. Our explorations have scattered us to places with no explanation for where we are and what we have become. The distances between us are now immeasurable in our isolation because the lengths that span the negative space between you, myself, and the reader have now grown beyond the logistical realm of this world and penetrating the temporal vacancies of space forced between us by an army commanded by no such thing.

The revelation of our forfathers articulates a culmination for our interpretive spirits to administer. The revelation of _myself_ is a question of posterity in light of the ghost's declaration of inheritence. My throne, its watchmen, and the surrounding battle is also echoed throughout the world. This perpeutal battle for indentity, protection of domain, and grip on artistic copyright has revealed itself to me as nothing new. The supernatural awakening that was once dormant, in myself and the rest of the world, is reporting for duty. The previous two orbits around the sun have strenghtened me in my trials and tribulations and the fortification of my heart seeks love that finds resolution in God.

Silicon Valley has grown like a desert into the silicon beaches of Los Angeles, the silicon forests of Portland, and the silicon allies of New York. A person lost in the desert will find temptations to follow a mirage on the horizon where they find no water. Many of us are lost in this arid climate. The illusions we find in these landscapes seem to come from demonic places and the orchestration of no such thing is incomprehensible when considering this current chapter to be the plans of any human endeavor.

If I was the skipper of a sailboat, and someone went overboard, I would not ask them to swim back to the boat. There would be a figure-eight maneuver, a life-preserver to pull yourself in, and a hand to help if and only if you asked for one. That is something a teacher taught me on Lake Mendota. Every lesson began with that figure-eight maneuver. My prayers have been for everyone to put in the same effort as those instructors have in teaching each other how to save a life.
