The moment

you wonder

what's in

a name,

the return

is sound,

by recursion

the next

and only

loop around.

Two chimes

are facts.

The words

keep pace.

To know,

I wonder,

what's in

a space?
```

###### Memory
```text
This beach has a silicon memory.

This memory has a personal recollection.

This recollection has a written record.

This record has a working title.

This title has a reserved space.

This space has an untold story.

This story has a love letter.

This love letter is a story.

This untold story is a space.

This reserved space is a title.

This working title is a record.

This written record is a recollection.

This personal recollection is a memory.

This silicon memory is a beach.
```

###### No Water
```text
Clarity for us is etched glass

created from the sands within our heartbeats

that bind two facts of life together,

her and I,

in rhythm and rhyme

turning in dance

towards the conflagration

following the one last chime.
