# The Earthquake

This particular account starts with my Russian friend, Ruslan. He found me at this temporary place in Chicago on North Ashland Avenue. Still, to this day, I think he was a spy. Do not be alarmed by this. "You KGB fuck", I would sometimes say to him in jest, but for fun, check this out.

Russ and I walked around Chicago together and there was something about him that told me he was on a mission of some kind. I mean, it was almost as if he was tasked to show me the city. One afternoon him and I shared lunch together, but what I really liked about him was how he liked to share his food. There is a particular kind of emotion that comes from sharing and giving. I could tell that Russ was the same way. It was not just food he shared, it was also bits and pieces of culture that I very much needed and missed over the years. I was lacking more than I thought. Russ knew that. Russ stuck around until he felt confident I was back to normal. Russ likes boxing and he loves Mike Tyson. If not for this kind of friendship, I may have never snapped out of the cultural trance I was caught in.

Russ is my height and has a Russian accent, but he looks Asian. He said he grew up in Chicago, but the accent tells me that he spent some time over seas. This kind of loyalty and respect was something that I missed from my friends in Los Angeles. Assuming Russ was sent by someone or assuming he acted on his own, I could sense that he actually cared. There was a lot of patience on his part.

If you ever watched the movie, Stand By Me, you might remember that scene with the train. Do you remember when Vern lost his comb and had to take it slow across those tracks by crawling on his knees? If you pay close attention, you'll notice that Denny stayed behind him the whole time despite the impending danger of the train that was surely going to run them off the tracks to certain death. Denny was there to push him forward and never left him. The other half of the crew yelled towards them encouraging them to hurry to safety. That is the kind of loyalty and friendship that I value more than any other in life because I will tell you that a man cannot survive without that kind of love for your brother. This is the way I wish we all were with each other once again. I firmly believe that this lack of brotherly love is the cause of many of the world's problems. Here in the states, it seems a lot of people forgot this lesson.

On the train, Russ called me one day asking for help. He was humble enough to admit the reason for his disposition. He just needed money, and that is fine, but I barely had any. I still sent him $300 of the $1200 in my account. Consider the emotions you feel when you take care of a friend without expectation or call for debt. The bond you form will be one of the most valuable things you may experience. It is something beyond loyalty and exists as one of those special relationships in life.

I was kicked out of the Airbnb, that Russ and I shared, for smoking weed. I quickly found another. After about a week in this new place, there was a knock on my door. I opened it and and there was the host of my Airbnb. She was wearing makeup and dressed in nicer clothes. She handed me a brown paper bag, I peaked inside. There was a single donut sitting at the bottom. She said that someone brought her donuts and there was one left for me. After thanking her, I closed my door and set the paper bag on the shelf and forgot about it. That night I paged through _Figures of Speech_ authored by Virgil Abloh and watched _Mystery of Chessboxing_ screened by 36cinema. Afterward, I stayed on the 36cinema website to listen to Rza's commentary of the film. There was a selfie taken in that bathroom mirror. I wrote in my diary until it was late.

I remember eating that bakery the next day and getting sick. It was my stomach. It was a familiar pain, at first, as if I had to use the bathroom soon to pass whatever was causing this. The pain lingered longer than usual. As it got worse, I decided it was best to lay my stomach with my arms fully extended and my face partially pressed into the blanket that covered the mattress. Something about that stomach ache felt different. I began to worry. As I laid there, face down, my worry turned into a mild panic. For some unknown reason thoughts of death appeared. Where did they come from? They appeared suddenly, but I did not fight them off.

I began to think about God. It was if I was pretending to prepare for death at any moment. Often times, my mind enters this land of make-believe that allows the reasoning of my mind to absorb all possible considerations of my heart. God was there and I began to talk to Him. I may not remember what I said, but once I truly accepted death as an option that day, I felt like a soldier. My faith in God destroyed all thoughts of fear and I remember thinking that, since this was His decision, I better make this look admirable.

After I got up from that bed, with my mind in order, I headed for the bathroom to sit down because it really felt like I had to go. Directly in front of me was the cabinet below that mirror where I took that selfie. Draped over the cabinet door was a blue hand towel that read, "All blue skies from here." I have to admit, that worried me a little, but that was the last thing I remember before I woke up on the bathroom floor. When I woke up, the pain was gone. I had plenty of energy. I looked around the bathroom to see if there was anything to clean up, but there was nothing. It was a miracle.

I wondered if I died and God brought me back to life, but imagine that consideration for yourself. Would you tell anyone? Would you have to? There is this unfamiliar enhancement I still feel that started the moment I woke up in that bathroom. Those feelings bring an extra love for life and everything around me gets a much closer look at its details - almost like a superpower, but I still consider that to be my empathy. Sometimes, the empathy I have for others is so strong I have to distance myself from the source. Sometimes I cannot. Sometimes empathy brings sadness or pain. Sometimes my empathy makes me want to curl up in a ball clutching my head as these overwhelming thoughts allow for none of my own. Maybe that is my new superpower. Maybe God is still teaching me how to use it. Sometimes, the thoughts I have in these moments really do not feel like my own. I know how insane that may sound, but these days is not everything upside-down?

There is no claim to have an ability to read minds, but what I do claim to have is this ability to sense the true intentions of others. It is all about your body language and how people carry themselves. This includes the way people talk. If I am tuned in to what you are saying, then please know I can sense the tone you are using, the tone you want to use, and the tone you should be using. This is to imply that, if you are lying or exaggerating, I will always know. Everything seems to start there. I am still learning to handle this new perspective that I do not know much about yet, but I can tell you it has made me much less inclined to socialize. People are too overwhelming for me these days. When it is voluntary, it is absolutely amazing. For you, as a warning, I can leave your head spinning if you allow me to become interested in anything you have to say.
