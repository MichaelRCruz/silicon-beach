# The Simplest Form of Beauty

// ## Information Oriented Architecture

Our intellectual interpretation of electromagnetic radiation, or lightnulbs, can only be studied with the human eye. Any computer assistance can help us further understand its complexities, but this leads will lead us into other areas of realted interest such as optics. Consider, then, the only means of perception we have for these types of human observations.

What if we could build a telescope with broader capabilities? An instrument that is based off the objects we drew in our imaginations? We could use Eddison bulbs that formed a matrix in such a way that resembles a set of satellites for each vertex of our imaginative cube. The challenge, then, becomes the coordination of these eight hypothetical satellites and someting else.

Eddison bulbs appear to have this effect when observing the illusion or three-dimensional radiation, or lack thereof, compared to lightbulbs that appear to illuminate, not only the three-dimensional proximal space, but moreso the three-dimensional shape it appears to cast. An attempt to llustrate this is as follows.

## A Fillament of Litterature, in draft

A boat just moments before it sails through the eye of the wind has two lights. The edison light is always port and stern while the starboard light is bow. The camera will capture the edison light and the seams of the universe.

The point they all intersect has more than four lines of deliniation. This means it is not the corner of a four sided cube or I am unable to accurately mesaure the division for that _corner_. My suspicion is that at least one other edison light is required to end the first position if points in imagination represented edison bulbs.

The extent of this for me is the observation of the starboard light and the silhouette it creates. The beams of port light have another vector and I think it is illuminating some other side, but why does port still have an afterglow?

# The Voyage


Eddison bulbs have this interesting property that I can only understand with the contrast I observe with the kind of light that can be used to measure paralax. This is the same light as the sun. Eddison bulbs just look different to me.

The collisions though is where people fall in love. Let this be the reason you would choose a cube over a anything that can fit inside. Even, in two dimensions, the circle should have no lines of division and its next complication will also argue for the ideal shape for photographs, To provide a profile picture, the next thing an app will do is subtract from that area until a lower bound is hit. As humans, we stop there and choose not to abstract the next square because the is an obvious degradation of fact with two states of rest or an upper and lower bound. At what limit does your thing approach either bound? This is the essence of calculus as the resulting observation after a you understand the rates of change. One book cover is integration and the back cover is derivation.

Since they stitch across one another, then just pick one and that is your path across the atlas. In sailing this shape is just like a zig-zag. Watch out for the boom when you push your tiller away from yourself to is it angled towards the other side of the boat where you now need to be. That is the way you have to move it. The first thing you notice is it can be a rather gentle push, but the wind will tell you where an upper bound and a lower bound is for the wind in every conceivable direction the wind can be blowing. This is usually between the giant roman numerals on the horizon, of X and II on your wind clock, 10 and 2 on your watch, but originally 10 and 2 on the wall clock of your giant boyfriend's kitchen clock.
