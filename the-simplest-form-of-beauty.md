# The Simplest Form of Beauty

## How Odd, I Can't Even?

0. It's so beautiful.

1. Just listen. Pretend you fully understand the measurement that you might observe from literally anything. To slice it into only two abstractions is a luxury of choice. Your space is divided evenly or or unevenly, but to have consideration for nothing requires division. This should support their theories of discreet math and the like.

2. Maybe the reason is not that you cannot divide by zero, but rather you _have_ to divide. Maybe divided-by-zero is actually a shitty band name.

3. A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds.

4. Like a wanning moon returning light approaching zero or the waxing light approaches one?

5. In make-believe michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him.

6. He is so far away.

7. He is big enough that it is comfortable to observe the entire history of the universe.

8. In one stream inside a human box office, lol.

9. He lives forever so time means nothing to him.

10. However, if you really think about it.

11. If his eyes were good enough, your giant boyfriend could see everything that ever happened in history.

12. Here is the part that scares everyone.

13. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with your digital video recaller.

14. The boyfriend giant watches nature all day when you are at work,

15. At night _the boyfriend giant_ uses the stars or the moon to navigate by any means necessary.

16. If you were to ask me if it was worth it, I would say for our sake yes, but just-in-case remember that we designed our existence on the premise that we cannot change the past. Imagine a world with no history.

17. Imagine a world with no future.

18. We could discuss this, forever. Before we hang up, check this out.

19. Who?

. . .

0. Hello!

1. Wait, you're not moving.

2. Are you there?

3. Can you see me now?

4. Yeah...can see you?

5. What's going on?

6. Alright. Are you there? Check this out...

7. Yeah.

8. One day, I closed my eyes and found these five three-dimensional boxes. They were just floating there.

9. Are you there?

10. Maybe it was that time when I was a kid with the psychologist,

11. Was it that story prompt he gave you?

12. Yeah, it loops recursively, or at least does now, lol.

13. Those cubes?

14. Yeah, I drew them on paper. Remember that empty room I first opened?

15. Was it the one you had to live in?

16. What? No. These rooms are just for these angels to have a place to gather. I don't know.

17. That sounds incredible, remember Wind Waker on Game Cube?

18. I know.

19. but

20. Check this out though. That same day, it occurred to me that these empty spaces in my heart were not really locked.

21. how

22. I thought to myself. That is when they these angels just started showing up.

23. Check _this_ out, though. Guess what else showed up for you?

24. My folders and notebooks from college?

25. Can you believe I saved every _single_ one for you?

26. Yeah, that is beyond me. Considering my current occupation, I might need to just get home from work. Gotta go.

27. Since you are floating on deep water, think about how fucking deep it really is?

28. The waters of the sea are so deep that there is no sunlight.

29. Why does the light stop? Does this imply that the frictionless environments, like space, may not exist?

30. What if they do, but the elements that light shines through have this effect of enhancing its course throughout the galaxy.

31. The elements of nature are moved by entropy.

32. If everything started with a bang, then what does the curvature of light look like?

33. How could your calculator graph this.

34. How could you graph this if a moment could be observed twice?

35. Could boyfriend giant write software to process that film?

36. It does not seem easy, but it should be.

37. You will have to consider the correct depth.

38. There is a telescope that allows myself to see the surface of these cute sunsets on the horizon.

39. In make-believe michaelville, they are exploratory spaces just like snacks.

40. If she is out there, on the water, maybe in irons like I was, then I will let her use my telescope even if that means making one with your 3D printer.

41. This is my telescope. There are many like it and all of them are mine.

42. Check this out. Imagine fifty-two playing cards.

43. First imagine an electronic letter sent to my inbox. That is where you will find that special value.

44. I very much want to decide on my occupation, but that does not matter because I am unaware of the list of priorities you have running in time.

45. So, what?

46. There was something I noticed in the light the other day that I need to tell her and the reader about.

47. Yeah

48. For me, purple light is slower in speed comparatively speaking to the other hues or colors or whatever.

49. I noticed it twice with my eyes.

50. It reminded me of this pen-pal from childhood. The letter was delivered with a picture of them.

51. Did something weird happened that day at recess?

52. I sat on the playground, with my back resting against the wall, and wondered what was happening with my eyes.

53. Was that photograph stereoscopic.

54. Maybe. My pen-pal was wearing this combination of blue and red, but the tie was floating into some other dimension.

55. Maybe it was finally at its destination.

56. Does this mean ultra violet light needs a closer look?

57. Is stereoscopic vision easier to obtain than it sounds?

58. That is what it is, basically.

. . .

## The Telescope

Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by the idea of or notion for or understanding that you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could also say that is as close as it gets. Not to be cryptic, but it is true that to consider this to be God if we have considered unfairness. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all. Still, how nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this point if it was not for literally everything thing that happened. Including the bad stuff. Someone will call this unfair too, but what if your life was not over even after death? If Christmas was not commercialized, would you remember it every year?

If you wanted to contemplate the logic of love, then try to define an action that yields a union by connecting two spots with a taut line. The lines will collect to reveal an object resembling a cube. In an effort to understand the significance of cubed properties, then run a diff on the sequence of form until the cusp of simplicity is achieved. It seems that I have found two building blocks. One for life and the other for life. These two objects build the map, do the dance, and march through an infinite oblivion.

Your telescope is fun to look at, but if you really want to know how to see, then we have to work through these thought experiments first.

## The Simplest Form

###### Figure 0

### The First Dimension

If you think about it, a point in space, or a point in the air, or some point on a painters canvas is difficult to imagine. The artist will never _truly_ rpresent this kind of point. You could stand a still as possible, facing your easel, but nothing could represent a point. You will have to use your imagination. Scientists, engineers, artists, and math people have to do this every day for their job.

Picture one. Try to imagine, maybe, a reference point. _Location_ might be more descriptive here. The other interesting part is that this point is not conceivable unless you have a pair. My point is that a location is interesting, but makes no sense in this thought experiment.

### The Second Dimension

###### Figure 1
```text
@----------------@
```

Start with a pair of locations, then, or points in space. For this second part, though, connect the two with a straight line. For demonstration purposes, please make sure the line is perfectly straight, or taut.


###### Figure 2

```text
@----------------@
|                |

|                |
|                |
@----------------@
```

Make a copy of the previous figure, but use your imagination to connect them together depicted in the next figure. Try to resemble two sets of parallel lines that create four points of intersection, `@`.


### The Third Dimension

###### Figure 3
```text
A------------------B
|\                 |\
| \                | \
|  \        X      |  \
|   \              |   \
C----\-------------D    \
 \    \             \    \
  \    E-------------\----F
   \   |              \   |
    \  |               \  |
     \ |                \ |
      \|                 \|
       G------------------H
```

Follow the pattern through this next position in an effort to resemble a cube. The pattern is duplication of the lower-order dimension. The pattern then draws lines of division to each corresponding vertice. Duplication & contact, duplication & contact, duplication & contact, and then the figure of form.

If you are careful, figure 3 illustrates something interesting. It is not mathematically profound nor does it add to the knowledgebase of any scientific discipline. For myself, this exercise introduced me to time. For now, that allowed me to consider the order those positions will have paired with the other processing pattern. This next processing pattern was conceived using the comparison of a two kinds of shapes and the properties of the dimensions described into position.

#### The Comparison

Time and process have an end in this system, but they seem to be different. Maybe they are the other of each other. Try to find a song in the processing pattern of a four-sided pyramid and a cube. Would the utility of two objects have an absolute value greater than zero? Is there an inherent factor of multiplicity for an object in space? If there is a counterexample to this imaginative reasoning, then let me know.

#### The Termination

If you can visualize a _cubed_ linear growth pattern, it approaches infinity in six potential vectors. The four-sided pyramid has five potential vectors. Only one of the pyramid vectors _can_ lead to infinity, but the other four sides are not asymptotic nor will they find infinity. There is a termination, I think. I have to account for the base of the pyramid and the cube for this to be sound. Because of this, there should be a base to the cube as well. A cube and a four-sided pyramid need an orientation kind of because of gravity and also because of perception. Knowledge and experience was had here on Earth.

There seems to be a **termination** obtainable for some objects. For others, the volumes of these objects seem to approach infinity. The visualization is quite illuminating if you can imagine a pair of dice, but round both to perfection so basically a sphere to place inside each of the two objects. Each sphere has these assumed properties allowing them no friction unless there you could consider a quarell at bounce.

#### The Juxtaposition

If you take all the hits ever in every game of baseball, then
