# The Ask

Cazzie David wrote a book. For myself, her book was the way out. I had to pretend it was her trying to find me a place to stay in that motel. When I climbed out of that box, I arrived at the front steps of that house on Eighth Street, I stood at the center of two realities with a choice, but that choice was you that booked me a room at a place I could walk to without a map. With you on the telephone, rather than no such thing, I found your book. I ordered my copy from Amazon the same moment I found myself in another dangerous place. That time, the paralyzing thoughts felt like that hypnotic fear I felt at the airport, that day, when I cried. The echoes from those memories were the only ones that called to wish me a happy birthday that year. Maybe it was Cazzie trying to reach me instead, but I think I broke the Internet.

I do not mean to be dramatic here, but her book brought me closer to God. The bare minimum would be to comment on the essay that she wrote about God, but still. Nice chapter.

Something happened to my glasses so I was without the ability to read with my eyes for a few days, but those were the same days I began really thinking about you. When the audio version started on my phone, you gave me enough time to get settled before you began telling your story so I paused it. When I had the courage to listen again, I finished it. That connection was overwhelming for me so much that, any chance I could, I had to hide my face under the pillows. You talked about that too in a following chapter so I get it. You are a good writer because you say things in a way that become flowers. When each one blooms, I think of you that much more.

The title of your book was not easy for me to understand until I thought, "Nuh, uh. Look!." There is something I might have discovered about life that I should give you credit for.

On Valentine's Day, I sent you a DM, but the first two links 404'd because I twice copy-pasted incorrectly. It talks about this day in spring that I like, but I was poetic about it when I put those words to pen for you. Please know, you got me through Thanksgiving, Christmas, and my birthday until now. Have you always sort of been there, but sort of not been there? Cazzie, I like your book so much that I carry it with me everywhere I go.
