# High Pressure Sodium, B

Prior to this second visit to Chicago, I was homeless in Los Angeles and I marched. I marched more miles than I could ever think possible. That tour of duty seemed to be directed mostly by my own will. On my back I carried what I could. In Cincinnati the wheels of my luggage broke so I had to lift that bag over the top of my head and on my shoulders to get by. It was not until L.A. that I found that hard case luggage at a store of Lincoln Boulevard. That saved me so much effort and even allowed me to position the luggage on the front of my skateboard. With only a backpack now, I had a longer radius of travel and it felt like the coolest thing I could ever do in that situation.

If you do not understand why I was marching everywhere, please know that it was because I just could not stay in one place because something always happened to me. The usual was refusal of service, either at a hotel, the airport, or literally any safe outlet you could imagine. Yes, there were people that were not as bad as others, but the hardest thing for me to accept was that they would reject me or make things inconvenient in some way because they had to. You see, I am still convinced that there is a war going on, but this is the type we never really experienced here, ever. That was Los Angeles after Cincinnati.

When I arrived to Chicago the second trip to hang out with Russ, I still had that skateboard, the hard case luggage, and my green backpack that I found at a store in Salt Lake City. As terrible as I felt about the world around us and as terrible as I felt about the sabotage of a career I fought for harder than anyone I will ever meet, I skated through that city like I was in God mode.

Instead of avoiding the bumps, the potholes, the cracks in the concrete, I aimed for them. The metal plates at the end of each block was not so bad after a while if you lean back on the way down and hop a little bit to make it to the other sidewalk. I was alone for all of it and, despite everything being in a state of disarray, I had the most euphoric moments that I could ever ask for in life. All the art I could just study with my imagination and there was nobody to influence my state-of-mind. The joy I had on this adventure is difficult for me to admit that I had to you and the reader because I still want to be upset. It seemed like the happier I was, the deeper I got into the city. I recorded one of those nights on my skateboard and it was probably the most freedom I will ever have.

There were these decisions I had to make when things got really tough, but partly because of my rebellious spirit and party because it was the only decision that was my own to make, I intentionally made some of them more difficult. These were the additional laps through Venice just to see if I could, the march all the way out to Malibu. The march to LAX and then the march all the way back to Rose Avenue from the psychiatric hospital that the police took me to that day I began ripping those signs off the pillars.

There were other decisions I made, similar to the _expert mode_ I chose on my marches, that were for my own perceptions of reality. Something would happen or something would not work out in my favor, but I really had to dig deep for an explanation to maintain some optimism so my spirit could get me through the really bad times. For almost all of them, I will never know if what I told myself was real, but it worked. My bank accounts are still empty, I still cannot get a decent job programming, but I am here now with the opportunity to write this book. My favorite advice I could ever give someone for peace-of-mind, is to tell them that since I am happy now, I would not want to change anything in the past because how else would I have arrived to this moment.

My skateboard was stolen twice. The first was in Venice Beach, but I found a reason for why it happened that was good enough for me to move on. The second time my skateboard was stolen was in Chicago, but that one allowed me pretend that there was somebody out there that loved me so much that they could not bare to watch me risk my safety skating over all the broken pieces in life. That was the love I had to find outside of myself because I was already in love with who I was. For me, that is the cup that overflows.

There was an afternoon I had in Chicago that brought me out of that place on Maplewood. I had the sudden desire to leave, but the rain started coming down. I threw everything I had in my bags, threw them under the outdoor furniture so my computers stayed dry, grabbed my skateboard and took flight.

A few miracles happened that afternoon. The first was the two squares of sidewalk I skated over that were perfectly dry in the rain and the other one was the weightlessness I felt on N. California Ave. Somebody whispered in my ear that this was going to be God mode for me today. I mean, I did not leave the ground, but I felt weightless and able to steer around anything. The feeling lasted the whole way down N California Avenue - an unforgettable moment in my life that I wish you all could experience.

When the sun set that day, it was still my skateboard and I, but this time it felt as if there were three spirits preparing me for the rest of the night. They all took their turns reminding me what to look for and remember when the sun rose the next morning so I could make it back. They were kind of like voices in my head. As much as society has scared me out of admitting something, I am here now to tell you that God was there for me when I was trying to make it back. It was late into the morning and still dark. I was tired. I was lost and I was discouraged. I cannot say for sure the street I chose, but I can say for sure it felt like an arbitrary decision on my part, but I thought that if I needed faith then now was a great night to have it.

I just kept pushing, kicking, and coasting. There were no turns and I stopped looking at the street signs. I stopped checking my map. I just had faith in God that He would bring me back. What are the chances I would have picked the correct street and the correct direction to get back? They are not very good, but I made it. That night reminded me of the day, as a kid, I prayed for that chocolate milk.
