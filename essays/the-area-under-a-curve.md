<h1>The Area Under a Curve</h1>
<p>
    When I wrote part of this in my motel room, November 23 in 2020, you, the reader, and myself must return to the search for completion that led to these moments. This make-believe story is still all facts. These events really did happen. Allow me to begin with Larry David and that day I woke up from a nap on the home-field bench of that baseball diamond in Wicker Park.
</p>
<p>
    Last summer, in 2020, I really was at a point in my life that could relate to Bradley Cooper's character in _The Silver Linings Playbook_. There really is a _silver lining_ in life, but it took a little _make-believe_ to see it, but also something else.
</p>
<p>
    In my jouranl I account for this thought, but my mind still brings me to Wicker Park and hopefully can serve as a bridge to the choice I made regarding the title of this chapter. My make-believe would not make sense wihtout Larry David, a protagonist in my story, and that is why we start there. Please do not forget this is a love story. It could also be a romantic comedy, but in that movie, would I be the baker or the street performer? Maybe it was all just the tale of my pursuit of happiness where sincerity promised to tell you when I do not understand something.
</p>

    That same afternoon, and in an effort to maintain my sanity, I tried to figure out the area under the curve of a baseball diamond. I needed something like that to keep myself occupied, I probably thought. I tried a little bit, but I messed up one of the parameters when doing the arithmetic in my head. For some reason I assumed it was ninety feet from the pitching mound to home. A little bird told me my nunmbers were off so I got tired and took a nap.
</p>
<p>
    I layed on my back on the right-field banch and unintentionally fell asleep. When I woke up, I had my weed with me, so I had that going for me, which is nice. However, what really pissed me off was the guy pacing out this distance for me as if he was listening to everything I was saying. After all, it was not until that Airbnb, again in Chocago, where I started talking to myself. That story is for later, but let me finish telling you about the time my future wife was supposed to meet me in that park. If she did, and I was not there at 11am or Noon every day like I said I would, I am sorry, sincerely.
</p>
<p>
    I woke up crabby. I was still traveling, although I did not feel that was because I was very lost. He was wearing a hat that was not a baseball cap and a blue surgical mask. For some reason, there was Larry. I said, "fuck you" right away because I did not know who it was and that is just what I did that summer. Apologies to any fratricide. Please know that I love you very much, but was it not hilarious that day outside of that pizza place in Logan. None of you subscribed to my YouTube channel. I thought that was thew deal? Whatever it was, I was pretty crabby. Anyways, he said, "fuck you." right back, but with much more intent so I ran.

    On the way out of there, I slowed down a bit to ask myself if that was really Larry so I sat by the water fountain and opened up my laptop. I do not think I wrote anything in the park _that_ day, but Larry showed up again, but this time with a guitar. You played a song and even sang a little, maybe, but I do rememeber that vividly. I owe you an explanation because it felt like you were there to see _me_. People play guitars in parks and might overhear you doing math, but I did not get an RSVP.

<p>
    On the way out, I very much wanted it to be you so when I finally made it to the convenience store, I thought it would be nice to get us some sodas and snacks. I settled on two Pepsis and two Hershey bars with almonds. There were two other things I bought with those snacks. That information, I guess, is there for Cazzie because I have this feeling she is as confused as I was and still
    am. Almost everything inside me is saying it was not actually him that day, and it probably was something else, but it sure looked like Larry. He was just hiding under his mask and hat that was not a baseball cap.
</p>
<p>
    Hopefully, you all know that I had absolutely no idea what was going on that day at the park. For me, it was a summer of wondering, but still, what is going on, you guys? Why do I suddenly feel like I have super powers. Cazzie mentioned something like this in her book, but she described this as the feelings during the process of _getting_ the super powers, but not actually. For myslef, that is an exponential bummer for you because I feel like one.
</p>
<p>
    Dear, Cazzie. If that was all you, bravo! If not, what the hell going on?
</p>


<p>
    Please know that, yes, I was running that night. I just did not know. Hopefully, you are able to laugh about all that now. Your precense all over the place that night, like I still feel now, but last summer was like diving into a swimming pool for the first time, ever. I was a little chilly, but the water has become warm. Still, I cannot stop thinking about you. Please let me tell you more about that night amd maybe, then, we can chat.
</p>
<p>
    When I think about you, especially when times are rough, I _hear_ whispers warning me that you are crying. When I feel that, the thought stays with me for a few moments. Please know that I am alright, but it does not make me think about you any less often. Since I could only hear you crying, I became more confused when I saw your instagram pic with the makeup. It brought a whole new level of clarity to this, but then again, Nobody ever told me anything.
</p>
<p>
    When I ran to downtown Chicago, I laid on my hotel room bed in until I looked you up. At that point, I never saw any pictures of you before, but when I foud one, I started running again. This time it was on the way back to the hotel in case you were there too. You are so beautiful Cazzie, that when I first saw your photograph my thoughts became much slower. When I first heard your voice my thoughts became much faster so I went to hide under my pillow. I tweeted something to your dad that night, but I guess you are morally opposed to it so I never really tried finding your profile. What is a hopeless romantic? Is that me? What is a crazy person? Is that me?

    Where are all my friends? Why does the Allen Ginsberg poem,_America_, come to mind as I write these words to form?

<p>
    Why do I smell donuts sometimes. Why can I see your eyes when I close mine? Why do I hear your concerns or feel sad or very happy in a moment? Why does my laugh sound the way I imagine your laugh to sound like? Why does it feel like the subtotal of all my efforts is all for you? Why do I prepare for your sudden and unexpected arrival every night? Why does it feel like you are so close that I can actually smell your shampoo at night? Why do I feel like I can feel your touch the moments I can feel you thinking about me? When that happens, everything inside my body feels like you are laying there next to me. My heart beats faster, my body tingles from sensation all over and then I get this unexpected smile on my face like it was your own.
</p>
<p>
    These are the reasons I am in love with you, Cazzie.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe you actually did get my signal and this is how I am supposed to find you. Would you like to get coffee some day?
