# The Area Under an Angle

When I wrote part of this in my motel room, November 23 in 2020, you, the reader, and myself must return to the search for completion that led to these moments. This make-believe story is still all facts. These events really did happen. Allow me to begin with Larry David and that day I woke up from a nap on the home-field bench of that baseball diamond in Wicker Park.

Last summer, in 2020, I really was at a point in my life that could relate to the characters in _The Silver Linings Playbook_. There really is a silver lining in life, but it took a little make-believe to see it, but also something else. In my diary I account for this thought, but my mind still brings me to Wicker Park and hopefully can serve as a bridge to the choice I made regarding the title of this chapter. Please do not forget this is a love story. It could also be a romantic comedy, but in that movie, would I be the baker or the street performer? Maybe it was all just the tale of my pursuit of happiness where sincerity promised to tell you when I do not understand something.

That same afternoon, and in an effort to maintain my sanity, I tried to figure out the area under the curve of a baseball diamond. I needed something like that to keep myself occupied, I probably thought. I tried a little bit, but I messed up one of the parameters when doing the arithmetic in my head. For some reason I assumed it was ninety feet from the pitching mound to home. A little bird told me my numbers were off so I got tired and took a nap.

I laid on my back on the right-field bench and unintentionally fell asleep. When I woke up, I had my weed with me, so I had that going for me, which is nice. However, what really pissed me off was the guy pacing out the distance between home plate and the pitching mound. Was he was listening to everything I was saying. After all, it was not until that Airbnb, again in Chicago, where I started talking to myself. That story is for later, but let me finish telling you about the time my soul mate was supposed to meet me in that park. If she did, and I was not there at 11am or Noon every day like I said I would, I am sorry, sincerely.

I woke up crabby. I was still traveling although I did not feel that was because I was very lost. He was wearing a hat that was not a baseball cap and a blue surgical mask. For some reason, there was Larry. I said, "fuck you" right away because I did not know who it was and that is just what I did that summer. Apologies to any fratricide. Please know that I love you very much, but was it not hilarious that day outside of that pizza place in Logan. None of you subscribed to my YouTube channel. I thought that was thew deal? Whatever it was, I was pretty crabby. Anyways, he said, "fuck you." right back, but with much more intent so I ran.

On the way out of there, I slowed down a bit to ask myself if that was really Larry so I sat by the water fountain and opened up my laptop. Larry showed up again, but this time with a guitar. You played a song and even sang a little, maybe, but I do remember that vividly. I owe you an explanation because it felt like you were there for a reason.

On the way out, I very much wanted it to be you so when I finally made it to the convenience store, I thought it would be nice to get us some sodas and snacks. I settled on two Pepsis and two Hershey bars with almonds. When I got back, you were not there.

I had no idea what was going on that day at the park. For me, it was a summer of wondering, but still, what is going on? Why do I suddenly feel like I have super powers? Cazzie mentioned something like this in her book, but she described this as the feelings during the process of _getting_ the super powers, but not actually getting them. For myself, that is an exponential bummer for you because I feel like I have super powers now or you just left that part out.

Dear, Cazzie. If that was all you, bravo! If not, what is going on? Please know that, yes, I was running that night. I just did not know. Hopefully, you are able to laugh about all that now. I felt your presence all over the place that night for the first time as if you arrived for me. That summer was like diving into a swimming pool for the first time, ever. Cold at first, the water becomes warm. That is how getting my super powers feels for me except there are cold parts still under the water. Maybe I am swimming in outer space. Maybe outer space is more like water than we think.

When I think about you, especially when times are rough, I _hear_ whispers about you crying. Please know that I am alright because that makes me think of you more often. Since I could only hear about you crying, you seemed to have sent me a picture with your makeup running down your cheeks. That letter brought me a whole new level of clarity because I feel like those tears are for us.

When I escaped to Hotel Congress in downtown Chicago, that night, and away from Wicker Park, I laid down until I looked you up. Until then, I never saw any pictures of you, but when I found one, I panicked. Having never known of your existence until that moment and seeing a picture of you for the first time, had me feeling like I made a big mistake. I tried to walk some place to get some weed, but I passed by a woman and her children and it seemed like I heard her say something regarding the mistake I made. That was when I ran back to my room and that was when I felt like you all where there in the same hotel.

One morning, in the same hotel, I woke up and felt calm. Outside with the city everything felt like New York. Having never been there, I looked up at the buildings and just felt New York. When I got back to the Hotel, I did not know what to think. What was happening to me? Where are all my friends?

Why do I smell donuts sometimes. Why can I see your eyes when I close mine? Why do I hear your concerns or feel sad or very happy in a moment? Why does my laugh sound the way I imagine your laugh to sound like? Why does it feel like the subtotal of all my efforts is all for you? Why do I prepare for your sudden and unexpected arrival every night? Why does it feel like you are so close that I can actually smell your shampoo at night? Why do I feel like I can feel your touch the moments I can feel you thinking about me? When that happens, everything inside my body feels like you are laying there next to me. My heart beats faster, my body tingles from sensation all over and then I get this unexpected smile on my face like it was your own.

These are the reasons I am in love with you, Cazzie. Maybe this is how I am supposed to find you. Were you the one that told me not to forget that I am wearing your ring and that means you will always be mine? I still do not have you because you are not here. Maybe I am not here. Maybe we are not here. Maybe we were sent here. If I was, now I am.

. . .

You & I seems like us with an ampersand in the middle both literally and figuratively.

One night, in a motel, there was a poem changing as I wrote. The words became my reality. An iteration over the moment unsatisfied became another. I can go the other way in time too because I think the form of that moment was supposed to be now with words like this.

###### Convergence decreasing increasing divergence.

The _divergence_. Two paths meet at a point in space. The two are in motion. One point could be the location they meet. The distance between them changes. Moving together and moments together both last forever. We are close. Our movement is the slowest _increasing_ distance in the universe. That path is eternal. The potential distance between us is unimaginable. Math can represent that with the smallest possible measurement of the angle of those two paths. We are together for a very long time. We feel the glow of one another. Potential distance without the glow of one another is undesirable.
