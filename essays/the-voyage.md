# Behind Every Man

The first bookstore, for myself as a kid, opened their doors for the suburb where I grew up. On my first visit there, the browsers inside really were scanning the tables holding the place of the furniture that had not yet arrived. The other day, for myself as an adult, on the shelf was my selection. The register rang up half of what I expected the cost to be. Prior to holding the receipt, I could feel something that had more room to grow. Perhaps that is what curiosity does for us as the potential growth carved space for itself in the future.

Science Fiction was alright mostly, but that means to ship with no implications. The movie is a longer read compared to the hardcover copy of a novel based on a screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. After reading the first words in a subtitle named _Forward_, the book, _2001 a space odyssey_, taught me something that added to the film I watched of the same story long before that day of winter in the bookstore. My gift from the past led to these suspicions that I may have missed much more from my first encounter with the film. For the novel, I will have finish reading after I return to the film where you find the first entry into orbit.

. . .

In the land on earth, as it appears through a lens, was an early scene with something that eventually makes a second appearance when the humans, depicted in the film, began to explore the dark side of the moon. Those two locations in space were bent in a way that set the pace for this progress I imagined as my interpretation settled at the end of the chapter. The author found a way to send his signal and I found a way to catch that wind that carried it where I am.

The novel describes a pair of objects that balance both ends of the copy I found on the shelf that day, but in my room it was not long before those words described a transition in time when a mirror reflected another mirror and together the two then contained all the entropy that still waits for life to make the waves on the waters of earth. The second time on the moon the object brought closure to a moment that, below the surface, were two realities that joined together a pair of characters as if they represented one human in an exploration of time.

In _2001_, the lunar object, the terrestrial object, and the _extra_ terrestrial object were the seams that join three realities. If the movements of those three locations connected as one entire system, it might help to visualize them as a deck of cards that can cast their own shadows all alone, but all together, the moments on each card stack up to a full deck that changes shape just enough to cast a more complicate shape on the wall.

Empathy with the character on earth sitting in wonder about their discovery watered a seed that sprouted branches of wisdom that once laid on their back covers prior to the conception of those terrestrial thoughts. They signaled an arc of lightning of the clouds that stormed a new understanding regarding my resulting perception of the interventions of our reality. That seems to be a destiny created by the mind of our species. Towards that destination you may pick a card, any card, and God will make sure that if one falls to the floor, He will carry it back to the stack that the cards belong to.

The final scenes of that film will toss a blend of thoughts that I hope will distribute any risk of horror that I might feel. Perhaps this is as an emotion that the filmmaker intended for me to find within myself and also a familiarity with what I remember.

 If you could have identical brothers, then what would three of them be called? For myself, that was three pairs of shoes delivered to your door when nature only intended for one. The parallelism to that in the film were the monoliths and the mystery of them that persuades the watcher to accept their anonymity, but a closer look reveals a layer underneath understood as observed effort as the measurement taken from the application by the programmer. That sounds close to the how I might describe the superficially intelligent. Scripture has many reminders told within the stories of the Bible so we worship God and no other. As a contributor to the intelligence we have given to our machines, there is a concern for adjectives I use to talk with you about God. The relief in that fear of God, a state-of-mind I have learned to love and hold, in preparation for days like this one. The day where He asked me to consider the impossibility of it was the same moment I could remember settling on that as a conclusion. In another moment, like now, the careful deliberation of anything that deep comes to a halt because what will not in the presence of God?

## Working Subtitle

Our intellectual interpretation of electromagnetic radiation, or light-bulbs, can only be studied with the human eye. Any computer assistance can help us further understand its complexities, but this leads us into other areas of related interest like optics. Consider, then, the only means of perception we have for these types of human observations.

What if we could build a telescope with broader capabilities? An instrument that is based off the objects we drew in our imaginations? We could use Edison bulbs that formed a matrix in such a way that resembles a set of satellites for each vertex of our imaginative cube. The challenge, then, becomes the coordination of these eight hypothetical satellites and something else.

. . .

Edison bulbs appear to have this effect when I  observe the illusion of their three-dimensional radiation. Through the window of my room, one night, I studied two light-bulbs in the distance that were like a pair of stars we see above. One star was an Edison bulb and the other star was not an Edison bulb. There was a surprising observation from the comparison of the two lights shined through the darkness between us. The wall that held both lamps brought my attention to the shape one light painted on the canvas and the atmospheric glow spray-painted by Edison onto the bricks he could reach.

At a safe distance from the center of the glow spark these lines of division into my eyes that I imagined as the edges of our dimension or where another dimension might be found next to our own. The vertex of these lines brings them as close to intersection as nature will allow. That similarity of the cube & the three-sided pyramid sets them apart from a sphere because their vertex is the distinguishing characteristic. With that distinctive form in mind, I hope to elaborate on the array of comparisons I learned from the light shinning through the window of my room because of the properties inside those two shapes.

## A Fillament of Litterature, in draft

A boat just moments before it sails through the eye of the wind has two lights. The Edison light will sit port at the stern while the starboard light is at the bow. This might be how a camera will capture the Edison light and the seams of our reality. Consider the starboard light as a camera and the silhouette that it must create. The port light has a different kind of vector and I think it is illuminating some other side.

The confidence I have towards any possible conclusion, here, is increased by the _compliments of form_ throughout the _layered perceptions of relativity_ of the cube and the three-sided pyramid. In other words, how much are they the same and how much are they different? If those two lists are balanced, then that satisfaction in reason and spirit, is the basis of the concept I like to describe as the _processing patterns_ of each form.

A processing pattern is bidirectional in growth if either process has an initial form of least complication and a final form that is without any external _collisions_. These are growth patterns that do not allow the trajectories of any of their paths to intersect, if and only if, their nature guarantees one direction towards infinity for the cube as well as the three-sided pyramid.

Scale those two back down to their initial forms to consider the internal properties of each. In the chair, I sat turned away from my window and looked up towards the corner of my room. There I was inside the box, but the digital video device next to my television reminded me of the logo bouncing through the same internal space as myself. After giving the object a third dimension, I considered the rotation the space might be in and if that movement would render the object stuck in a certain bounce that never ended. How many of those fixed reciprocal motions could that object be in? For the cube there are infinite, but that infinity has categories of a few. One is the corner-to-corner and those four movements compared to the infinite amount of side to side movements of the object.

The same treatment was applied to the three-sided pyramid, but the observation that gave warrant to proceed with these thoughts, was that the three-sided pyramid only has one reciprocal motion and zero places where the object is able to bounce towards infinity. That describes the next stepping stones of reason along my route.

I thought, then, if the next step would have consideration for any superiority of either least-complex form could be found. If not, then are those two a pair and also a set? In an effort to make this next leap, I needed a second factor of relative comparison. That became gravity, but the gravity in this thought experiment only had pull on the objects in their least complex form and not the objects moving inside them. If you are still with me, then something similar to the object found by the characters in _2001_ a space odyssey_ found on the moon next to a pyramid on earth in Egypt.

The collisions though is where people fall in love. Let this be the reason you would choose a cube over a anything that can fit inside. Even, in two dimensions, the circle should have no lines of division and its next complication will also argue for the ideal shape for photographs, To provide a profile picture, the next thing an app will do is subtract from that area until a lower bound is hit. As humans, we stop there and choose not to abstract the next square because the is an obvious degradation of fact with two states of rest or an upper and lower bound. At what limit does your thing approach either bound? This is the essence of calculus as the resulting observation after a you understand the rates of change. One book cover is integration and the back cover is derivation.

Since they stitch across one another, then just pick one and that is your path across the atlas. In sailing this shape is just like a zig-zag. Watch out for the boom when you push your tiller away from yourself to is it angled towards the other side of the boat where you now need to be. That is the way you have to move it. The first thing you notice is it can be a rather gentle push, but the wind will tell you where an upper bound and a lower bound is for the wind in every conceivable direction the wind can be blowing. This is usually between the giant roman numerals on the horizon, of X and II on your wind clock, 10 and 2 on your watch, but originally 10 and 2 on the wall clock of your giant boyfriend's kitchen clock.
