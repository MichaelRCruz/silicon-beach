# Behind Every Man

How could we consider of the idea to leave for any other planet if we cannot maintain a source of truth here on Earth? Imagine space travel. Would you trust _anything_ you heard from home? Eventually your crew will not trust anything they heard from earth without God. That is a long road, but the steadfast nature and approach to the maintenance of the truth would be levels above more encouraging for a space endeavor. How about we do that, but consider questions like the following.

If song could be copied and autonomously created by machine, where is the human identification? Do our artificially intelligent friends have a vibe? What does their music sound like? Could we find a signature to go along with our signals. Does the universe require certificates of authority? What if we started using one, just in case?

The first bookstore, for myself as a kid, opened their doors for the suburb where I grew up. On my first visit there, the browsers inside were scanning the tables holding the place of the furniture that had not yet arrived. This time, the register rang up half of what I expected the cost to be. Prior to holding the receipt, I could feel something that had more room to grow. Perhaps that is what curiosity does for us as the potential growth carved space for itself in the future.

Science Fiction was alright mostly, but, that means no such thing to a ship without such implications. A film is a longer read compared to a hardcover copy based on a screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. After reading the first words of, _2001 a space odyssey_, the suspicions may have missed myself much of something else, but science fiction was alright mostly.

In the land of earth, as it appears through a lens, was an early scene with something that eventually makes a second appearance when humans explored the dark side of the moon. Why who when what we waved was wattage when whole wraps with wire whereby weaved world wide webs?

The novel describes three objects that brings balance to the beginning, the middle, and the end of the copy I found on the shelf that day, but in my room it was not long before those words described a transition in time when a mirror reflected another mirror and together the two then contained all the entropy that still waits for life to make the waves on the waters of earth. The second time on the moon the object brought closure to a moment that, below the surface, were two realities that joined together a pair of characters as if they represented one human in an exploration of time.

In _2001_, the lunar object, the terrestrial object, and the _extra_ terrestrial object were the seams that join three realities. If the movements of those three locations connected as one entire system, it might help to visualize them as a deck of cards that can cast their own shadows all alone, but all together, the moments on each card stack up to a full deck that changes shape just enough to cast a more complicate shape on the wall.

Empathy with the character on earth sitting in wonder about their discovery watered a seed that sprouted branches of wisdom that once laid on their back covers prior to the conception of those terrestrial thoughts. They signaled an arc of lightning of the clouds that stormed a new understanding regarding my resulting perception of the interventions of our reality. That seems to be a destiny created by the mind of our species. Towards that destination you may pick a card, any card, and God will make sure that if one falls to the floor, He will carry it back to the stack that the cards belong to.

The final scenes of that film will toss a blend of thoughts that I hope will distribute any risk of horror that I might feel. Perhaps this is as an emotion that the filmmaker intended for me to find within myself and also a familiarity with what I remember.

Parallelism must have been the word I needed to describe the connections in all subjective truths that woke me up one morning in Chicago when I changed into another pair of those white shoes that walked me to a street corner where the wall I leaned into was there for the clouds. The clouds were there for my eyes. My eyes were there for a moment later. Later was there for now. Now is there to show me that that from both directions the art on both sides of the street reflected something soft enough to sleep to under the sun. When I woke up there was a reminder that I just found a full night of rest that morning, but the sounds in my ears changed the meaning of all the names _Death Cab for Cutie_ chose for their album _Transatlanticism_. Would "transpacificism" be a word echoed through time that maybe reflected off the wall at the same angle for _all of us then_ and also _all of us now_ or was actually _then_ there for the actual now?

That day of concentric circles of time must have been these new parallelisms also in my letter to Israel about the west Pacific and the east Atlantic oceans. Their retainment with the lines that divide and the lines that bind. My boat tipped from one of those waves and I fell asleep under the one of those recollections of that maple tree where no others grew.

Practically speaking, I did not get the physics of sailing on the lesson they were first described to me. I got them eventually and they went like this.

That was the wind that filled my sails and then I was no longer in irons. My body straightened out more, I looked in the direction of two on the wind clock one sid e of my boated lifted, and the sheet in my hand asked for more so I let go of it for an instant and the main sail snapped me to more than two, then to three. This release gradually turns you down or up the wall of the inside of a spinning top. The bow of your boat sweeps through the wall after you come about to the other side and the ocean and its earth beneath you have adjusted to your imagination.

A boat not under any wind power is like it looks. If you can see it just sitting there when the wind blows how does the boat move because I wondered what the first person that kinda figured it all out was feeling. Some one put the whole thing together and a miracle happened. What else is there except one more thing. When you finally built the boat would you say if the number of iterations meant anything to you? I can almost see you getting there fewer than expected because you must have could already see the twist of the boat against another twist the other way. If they braid, then those must be the two sides to take for one path. Through the eye of the wind, your bow goes back to the side across what you read as 2 and then 1 and then you read it back to yourself as 1 and then 2. So the third is twelve and 21 just in case.

A turntable will allow an object to rest while the surface underneath is moving anything on its surface. If you made a copy of that turntable and pasted it one half-turn above the first one, then would they be spinning in opposite ways? One turntable is above you as you look up. As you travel through the eye of the wind, the other side is the turntable you were just looking at. This might be our movements through space for a ship.

The details of both descriptions have similar and different subtleties that just just close it up for you if you let them. The first example I see myself on the boat and can feel a tug on the sheet telling me to let out as the bow fought for the side where it was. The other way is the earth somehow much more than I can understand. Is the ocean almost negative in friction on its surface while the light that travels deep below will meet a resistance to where there is complete darkness.

Gravity is the weight that pulls down on a sailboat fighting to bring balance into perspective and the wind allows that. The lean of the boat, the boat with opposing forces, along opposing paths of travel, react to each other. If that makes sense, then that is how I imagine the physics of sailing to be.

## Working Subtitle

Our intellectual interpretation of electromagnetic radiation, or light-bulbs, can only be studied with the human eye. Any computer assistance can help us further understand its complexities, but this leads us into other areas of related interest like optics. Consider, then, the only means of perception we have for these types of human observations.

What if we could build a telescope with broader capabilities? An instrument that is based off the objects we drew in our imaginations? We could use Edison bulbs that formed a matrix in such a way that resembles a set of satellites for each vertex of our imaginative cube. The challenge, then, becomes the coordination of these eight hypothetical satellites and something else.

. . .

Edison bulbs appear to have this effect when I  observe the illusion of their three-dimensional radiation. Through the window of my room, one night, I studied two light-bulbs in the distance that were like a pair of stars we see above. One star was an Edison bulb and the other star was not an Edison bulb. There was a surprising observation from the comparison of the two lights shined through the darkness between us. The wall that held both lamps brought my attention to the shape one light painted on the canvas and the atmospheric glow spray-painted by Edison onto the bricks he could reach.

At a safe distance from the center of the glow spark these lines of division into my eyes that I imagined as the edges of our dimension or where another dimension might be found next to our own. The vertex of these lines brings them as close to intersection as nature will allow. That similarity of the cube & the three-sided pyramid sets them apart from a sphere because their vertex is the distinguishing characteristic. With that distinctive form in mind, I hope to elaborate on the array of comparisons I learned from the light shinning through the window of my room because of the properties inside those two shapes.

## A Fillament of Litterature, in draft

A boat just moments before it sails through the eye of the wind has two lights. The Edison light will sit port at the stern while the starboard light is at the bow. This might be how a camera will capture the Edison light and the seams of our reality. Consider the starboard light as a camera and the silhouette that it must create. The port light has a different kind of vector and I think it is illuminating some other side.

The confidence I have towards any possible conclusion, here, is increased by the _compliments of form_ throughout the _layered perceptions of relativity_ of the cube and the three-sided pyramid. In other words, how much are they the same and how much are they different? If those two lists are balanced, then that satisfaction in reason and spirit, is the basis of the concept I like to describe as the _processing patterns_ of each form.

A processing pattern is bidirectional in growth if either process has an initial form of least complication and a final form that is without any external _collisions_. These are growth patterns that do not allow the trajectories of any of their paths to intersect, if and only if, their nature guarantees one direction towards infinity for the cube as well as the three-sided pyramid.

Scale those two back down to their initial forms to consider the internal properties of each. In the chair, I sat turned away from my window and looked up towards the corner of my room. There I was inside the box, but the digital video device next to my television reminded me of the logo bouncing through the same internal space as myself. After giving the object a third dimension, I considered the rotation the space might be in and if that movement would render the object stuck in a certain bounce that never ended. How many of those fixed reciprocal motions could that object be in? For the cube there are infinite, but that infinity has categories of a few. One is the corner-to-corner and those four movements compared to the infinite amount of side to side movements of the object.

The same treatment was applied to the three-sided pyramid, but the observation that gave warrant to proceed with these thoughts, was that the three-sided pyramid only has one reciprocal motion and zero places where the object is able to bounce towards infinity. That describes the next stepping stones of reason along my route.

I thought, then, if the next step would have consideration for any superiority of either least-complex form could be found. If not, then are those two a pair and also a set? In an effort to make this next leap, I needed a second factor of relative comparison. That became gravity, but the gravity in this thought experiment only had pull on the objects in their least complex form and not the objects moving inside them. If you are still with me, then something similar to the object found by the characters in _2001_ a space odyssey_ found on the moon next to a pyramid on earth in Egypt.

The collisions though is where people fall in love. Let this be the reason you would choose a cube over a anything that can fit inside. Even, in two dimensions, the circle should have no lines of division and its next complication will also argue for the ideal shape for photographs, To provide a profile picture, the next thing an app will do is subtract from that area until a lower bound is hit. As humans, we stop there and choose not to abstract the next square because the is an obvious degradation of fact with two states of rest or an upper and lower bound. At what limit does your thing approach either bound? This is the essence of calculus as the resulting observation after a you understand the rates of change. One book cover is integration and the back cover is derivation.

Since they stitch across one another, then just pick one and that is your path across the atlas. In sailing this shape is just like a zig-zag. Watch out for the boom when you push your tiller away from yourself to is it angled towards the other side of the boat where you now need to be. That is the way you have to move it. The first thing you notice is it can be a rather gentle push, but the wind will tell you where an upper bound and a lower bound is for the wind in every conceivable direction the wind can be blowing. This is usually between the giant roman numerals on the horizon, of X and II on your wind clock, 10 and 2 on your watch, but originally 10 and 2 on the wall clock of your giant boyfriend's kitchen clock.
