# The Voyage

The bookstore, for myself as a kid, had their opening in the suburb where I grew up and when I walked in their that day there were no shelves because the tables they used held their books until the furniture arrived. The other day, for myself as an adult, the most recent book made me browse the rest of the store before I was allowed to take it home. The register rang up what I could afford and that was the moment I knew it was special. Science Fiction was alright mostly, but not to imply any favoritism, the movie is a longer read compared to the book version of _2001 a space odyssey_. This is to say that after the first sentence my life was never the same. The novel, by Arthur C. Clarke, taught me something that we may never see the entire picture of because how could we? The format could have been what allowed me to get enough of a glimpse regarding what is required for a turning point along the path we move.

In the land on earth, as it appears through a lens, played a scene with an object that eventually made another appearance when humans explored the dark side of the moon. Those two locations in space were bent in a way that set the pace for this progress I imagined as my interpretation settled at the end of the chapter. The author found a way to send his signal and I found a way to catch that wind.

The novel describes a pair of objects that balance both ends of the copy I found on the shelf that day, but in my room it was not long before those words described a transition in time when a mirror reflected another mirror and together the two then contained all the entropy that still waits for life to make the waves on the waters of earth. The second time on the moon the object brought closure to a moment that, below the surface, was two realities that joined a pair of characters as two humans in exploration.

Clarke's novel joined the club of authors who sit on a bookshelf of the collection of all my books that were never finished to the end. For _2001_, The lunar object was this seam that joined two realities: one on earth and the other side was some location beyond the moon. If the movements of those three locations are easy enough to visualize, then an interest in the way they might project another shape as a silhouette the system might have from a light pointed at the sun from another star.

The brilliance continued for me with empathy when the character on earth sat to wonder about the discovery. Those terrestrial thoughts signaled an arc of the lightning in the clouds that delivered a new understanding regarding my resulting perception of the interventions of our reality that seems to be created by the mind of our species.

. . .

Our intellectual interpretation of electromagnetic radiation, or light-bulbs, can only be studied with the human eye. Any computer assistance can help us further understand its complexities, but this leads us into other areas of related interest like optics. Consider, then, the only means of perception we have for these types of human observations.

What if we could build a telescope with broader capabilities? An instrument that is based off the objects we drew in our imaginations? We could use Edison bulbs that formed a matrix in such a way that resembles a set of satellites for each vertex of our imaginative cube. The challenge, then, becomes the coordination of these eight hypothetical satellites and something else.

. . .

Edison bulbs appear to have this effect when I  observe the illusion of their three-dimensional radiation. Through the window of my room, one night, I studied two light-bulbs in the distance that were like a pair of stars we see above. One star was an Edison bulb and the other star was not an Edison bulb. There was a surprising observation from the comparison of the two lights shined through the darkness between us. The wall that held both lamps brought my attention to the shape one light painted on the canvas and the atmospheric glow spray-painted by Edison onto the bricks he could reach.

At a safe distance from the center of the glow spark these lines of division into my eyes that I imagined as the edges of our dimension or where another dimension might be found next to our own. The vertex of these lines brings them as close to intersection as nature will allow. That similarity of the cube & the three-sided pyramid sets them apart from a sphere because their vertex is the distinguishing characteristic. With that distinctive form in mind, I hope to elaborate on the array of comparisons I learned from the light shinning through the window of my room because of the properties inside those two shapes.

## A Fillament of Litterature, in draft

A boat just moments before it sails through the eye of the wind has two lights. The Edison light will sit port at the stern while the starboard light is at the bow. This might be how a camera will capture the Edison light and the seams of our reality. Consider the starboard light as a camera and the silhouette that it must create. The port light has a different kind of vector and I think it is illuminating some other side.

The confidence I have towards any possible conclusion, here, is increased by the _compliments of form_ throughout the _layered perceptions of relativity_ of the cube and the three-sided pyramid. In other words, how much are they the same and how much are they different? If those two lists are balanced, then that satisfaction in reason and spirit, is the basis of the concept I like to describe as the _processing patterns_ of each form.

A processing pattern is bidirectional in growth if either process has an initial form of least complication and a final form that is without any external _collisions_. These are growth patterns that do not allow the trajectories of any of their paths to intersect, if and only if, their nature guarantees one direction towards infinity for the cube as well as the three-sided pyramid.

Scale those two back down to their initial forms to consider the internal properties of each. In the chair, I sat turned away from my window and looked up towards the corner of my room. There I was inside the box, but the digital video device next to my television reminded me of the logo bouncing through the same internal space as myself. After giving the object a third dimension, I considered the rotation the space might be in and if that movement would render the object stuck in a certain bounce that never ended. How many of those fixed reciprocal motions could that object be in? For the cube there are infinite, but that infinity has categories of a few. One is the corner-to-corner and those four movements compared to the infinite amount of side to side movements of the object.

The same treatment was applied to the three-sided pyramid, but the observation that gave warrant to proceed with these thoughts, was that the three-sided pyramid only has one reciprocal motion and zero places where the object is able to bounce towards infinity. That describes the next stepping stones of reason along my route.

I thought, then, if the next step would have consideration for any superiority of either least-complex form could be found. If not, then are those two a pair and also a set? In an effort to make this next leap, I needed a second factor of relative comparison. That became gravity, but the gravity in this thought experiment only had pull on the objects in their least complex form and not the objects moving inside them. If you are still with me, then something similar to the object found by the characters in _2001_ a space odyssey_ found on the moon next to a pyramid on earth in Egypt.

The collisions though is where people fall in love. Let this be the reason you would choose a cube over a anything that can fit inside. Even, in two dimensions, the circle should have no lines of division and its next complication will also argue for the ideal shape for photographs, To provide a profile picture, the next thing an app will do is subtract from that area until a lower bound is hit. As humans, we stop there and choose not to abstract the next square because the is an obvious degradation of fact with two states of rest or an upper and lower bound. At what limit does your thing approach either bound? This is the essence of calculus as the resulting observation after a you understand the rates of change. One book cover is integration and the back cover is derivation.

Since they stitch across one another, then just pick one and that is your path across the atlas. In sailing this shape is just like a zig-zag. Watch out for the boom when you push your tiller away from yourself to is it angled towards the other side of the boat where you now need to be. That is the way you have to move it. The first thing you notice is it can be a rather gentle push, but the wind will tell you where an upper bound and a lower bound is for the wind in every conceivable direction the wind can be blowing. This is usually between the giant roman numerals on the horizon, of X and II on your wind clock, 10 and 2 on your watch, but originally 10 and 2 on the wall clock of your giant boyfriend's kitchen clock.
