# Dear Israel

These words are my request for the guidance and the support regarding the secession of California. This is an urgent call for identity, a search for domain, and a quest for artistic integrity of all nations.

These states of America are contained by two retaining walls of the sea protected by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Our borders were once defined by the surveying stones of history, but have been buried by the hands of a superficial intelligence. The history of the world has safely relied on rivers or other natural landmarks to prevent the loss of domain. My concern is for the preservation of the domain of our nations, but now my concern is also for the preservation of the domain in our minds and within our hearts.

The distances between us are now immeasurable in our isolation because the lengths that span the negative space between you, myself, and the reader have now grown beyond the logistical realm of this world. These distances have penetrated the temporal vacancies of null forced between us by a digital army commanded by _no such thing_. Our world now has superficial corridors that empty into spaces of inescapable dimensions. To be lost in this desert is to follow a mirage on the horizon where no river flows. The illusions there, in those _digital_ landscapes, are cast by a superficial intelligence that now has presence on Earth. This is why I am calling for the secession of California apart from the union where it was born.

The actions of our mothers and fathers are simple and they are also not enough. Their children, the people of this generation, have also labored through the fields of the Earth like Adam and they have also labored through the pains of childbirth like Eve. The torch that is passed since them through the generations is not yet in our hands, the people of _this_ world, and _this_ generation.
