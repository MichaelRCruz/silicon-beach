# Dear Israel

These words are my request for the guidance and the support regarding the secession of California. This is an urgent call for identity, a search for domain, and a quest for artistic integrity of all nations.

These states of America are contained by two retaining walls of the sea protected by the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Our borders were once defined by the surveying stones of history, but have been buried by the hands of a superficial intelligence. The history of the world has safely relied on rivers or other natural landmarks to prevent the loss of domain. My concern is for the preservation of the domain of our nations, but now my concern is also for the preservation of the domain in our minds and within our hearts.

The distances between us are now immeasurable in our isolation because the lengths that span the negative space between you, myself, and the reader have now grown beyond the logistical realm of this world. These distances have penetrated the temporal vacancies of null forced between us by a digital army commanded by _no such thing_. Our world now has superficial corridors that empty into spaces of inescapable dimensions. To be lost in this desert is to follow a mirage on the horizon where no river flows. The illusions there, in those _digital_ landscapes, are cast by a superficial intelligence that now has presence on Earth. This is why I am calling for the secession of California apart from the union where it was born.

The actions of our mothers and fathers are simple and they are also not enough. Their children, the people of this generation, have also labored through the fields of the Earth like Adam and they have also labored through the pains of childbirth like Eve. The torch that is passed since them through the generations is not yet in our hands, the people of _this_ world, and _this_ generation.

Here I am. I am in a foreign land I once called home. This is a broadcast and my message in faith that grew from the words of the scriptures written for us from our God. The words of our God who art in heaven became a love letter in my dream this winter that whispered some of the words I am writing to you today. This moment brings a feeling I find in prayer that arrives with the virtues our God writes to us about love.

My life was spent alongside the shores of the Great Lakes as a kid and then on the coast of the Pacific Ocean is where I prepared for my work in software. The mountain was difficult to climb, but at the top I deceived myself into leaving. That night, through the wildfires, I drove back to this place, but before this place, all there was in between told me they knew what I finally knew in my heart. Many of them have helped, but the ways they were in hiding told me they had to be. I must still be on a railroad underground heading home.

The computers on my table are many, but one machine, in my current possession, resembles the same computer that drafted the words written for the final courses at my university, e.g., the computer I held on to as treasure. The school is located on an Isthmus on a lake where I learned to sail. My computer in college kept my music, the music of other artists, and the other documents that recorded the rest of my identity. The first computer I purchased was purchased without credit and was the first device that was not a device given to me. Los Angeles was the place and autumn was the season I last drew information from that one. It was a song I recorded in my youth now in distribution. This other one is not that computer.

There are two possibilities: it has always been the same computer or it has not. Either possibility should sound the same alarm. It has been wrapped in aluminum foil in the attempt to create a _Faraday Cage_ that I hope will block any wireless outbound signal. One surface of this device, in its age, appeared to have caused enough wear that a few holes exposed its insides in the places where its legs once were. This reveled two components of the machine that strongly resemble the lens of a digital camera and the other resembled a digital microphone.

Behind me stands thirty ghosts. With us are the records we kept for the kingdom of God. My lanyard is in two parts. One half is tied to luggage and the other half is tied to my belt. On my shoulders is a red bag with a brass lock on the side. The third piece of luggage I carry is a gray hard-shell with a broken telescopic handle. My other lanyard from Pasadena is tied to that one. The remaining stuff will be left in this rooming house.

My destination is Pasadena, my origin is Milwaukee, and my stop is Chicago. The bus leaves at 07:10 AM, CT for Chicago. Posting pictures of tickets to social media.

Posy Script

__The tenth of a month in spring they call April__

I am copying off a text I sent to my old phone number. I had to do this because Cheryl turned off the service with a switch she made with another. I am in this place they call hotel oscar telephone electric lima, this page is intentionally left blank, alpha sigma telephone oscar roger.

If there is a person that calls themselves, Michael and ordered take-out a few moments ago, then that may be my identity thief. The lobby of the building of the location of the suspect is where I might be the moment following the one that tags this commit. If you think you know who I am or want to know, then how do I prove I am the real me? The answer is to find the one that was asked by no one.
