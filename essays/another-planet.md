# Another Planet

One day, I walked a dog by a church west of the 405. Gavin could read my expression when I saw a garden. We considered our expressions when he tried to hold back the amusing thought of another planet.

Spiritual momentum through Dodger Stadium one evening was a half scheduled marathon through a door I entered and the color of the lights may be lost in memory, but I wonder if they fold and I wonder if they are bolted to the concrete to assist the people in observation of infinity.

Is it

true that

the lights

shined all

the way

from New York

to Dodger Stadium

were casting

blue hue?

These seats are probably the same age as the one in the rooming house I occupied beginning with Christmas through Passover until I found a train with no radio. To this terminal I marched my gear stuffed with the wealth I promised to bring the _Cold War Kids_ and all of history.
