# Another Planet

Beginning with the Eve of Christmas through the Eve of Passover, there was a chair I inadvertently left bolted to the ground and empty to the null.

The day I planned to leave for the terminal I found a train with no AM radio. I marched my gear stuffed with the wealth I promised to bring for the _Cold War Kids_ and for all of history. The pages within those book covers tell the story of the moon, the stars, and the door I opened to the back lot where the servants worked.

. . .

Spiritual momentum through Dodger Stadium one evening was a half scheduled marathon through a door I entered and the color of the lights may be lost in memory, but I wonder if they are spring-loaded or balanced to save space and I wonder if they are stationary and I wonder why no such thing folds your chairs in your restaurants. These seats are probably the same age as the one in the rooming house I occupied. These seats are probably the same age as the chairs in your restaurant.

Is it
true that
the lights
casting all
the way
from New York
to Dodger Stadium
are shining
blue hue?
```

. . .

Do we find meaning in the fact that the first marathon was made in haste.
