# Another Planet

Beginning with the Eve of Christmas through the Eve of Passover, there was a chair I inadvertently left

...brb

The day I planned to leave for the terminal I found a train with no AM radio. I marched my gear stuffed with the wealth I promised to bring for the _Cold War Kids_ and for all of history. The pages within those book covers tell the story of the moon, the stars, and the door I opened to the back lot where the servants worked.

. . .

Spiritual momentum through Dodger Stadium one evening was a half scheduled marathon through a door I entered and the color of the lights may be lost in memory, but I wonder if they are spring-loaded or balanced to save space and I wonder if they are stationary and I wonder why no such thing folds your chairs in your restaurants. These seats are probably the same age as the one in the rooming house I occupied. These seats are probably the same age as the chairs in your restaurant.

Is it
true that
the lights
casting all
the way
from New York
to Dodger Stadium
are shining
blue hue?
```

. . .

Do we find meaning in the fact that the first marathon was made in haste. Men have this certain way about them that is predictable especially if they are alone.

Michael is reasonable preference and seasonable emotion is Eve.

Lightning and thunder is rarely here in this space.

My name is spelled, m-i-g-u-e-l, in the future and in all of history because of art.

Art is the primal form of man.

Michael is reasonable preference and seasonable emotion is Eve. The moon and the sun are two on the surface of their existence. Deeper, on the other side, is this turn. This turn is a documented objective model named _adom_ or _Adam_ in Michael's Bible. Michael and Eve occupy the same space. To create life breathing for life is to create love breathing for love. If after life minus love is still life, then the grammatical intersection equals l & e. The inverse intersection is i-f & o-v.

If an inverse intersection and its intersection are reflective or a reflection, then life resembles functional programming more than I imagined. That realization feels like a shifting transmission and shifting a transmission. That realization feels like the flex of a bicycle frame.

Love minus zero divided by infinity feels like to be redundantly unhalved the other way and how I would explain it to myself at five orbits around the sun. That is basically how Cain described his reality to Abel, but maybe that is basically how Abel described his reality to Cain. They got this from Eve. One day she described this to Adam and it lived like this.

. . .

Eve read _his & her record-paper_ scratched onto the table where Adam sits and she wondered if her kids would always prefer one chair in life as well as learning. In the same moment she recalled Adam joking about this with her and that was just the way he liked to flirt with her. It was a "_working_ title" he would emphasize, "you know what I am saying, a figure of speech", he completed in English and in the memory of Eve. She rolled her eyes because she saw their future. The reason - its all hers. At least three: spades & clubs or diamonds. The future imagination of Eve, had _inside_ jokes the _other_ way. This was how she flirted back. When the product of 2020 and 2 spun them into Santa Monica, that year after death in high definition, she sun-gazed after the image in God from opposing corners of the table.

Eve sketched, "we are running out of shit" on the surface of her jet-black address book.
