# Another Planet

Beyond Santa Monica, Adam & Eve drove north-east towards the hills. They parked along the side of the road, rested above the lights east of Eden, and considered the longest moment in human history since their day until that day in 2021. Adam was beyond the recognition of his own wisdom and he was beyond the recognition of the art of man and all that was created. On the way into the hills, the idea that _art_ is the primal form of man began to manifest inside Adam's mind. His ideas for the future were trees that grew in the crust of his worldly ideas. His imagination created patterns of texture and shape. This is how he often visualized his thoughts and how he expressed himself for her. His textures were often charming to Eve.

The emotions, from those thoughts, were already showing on his face when his body language caught the attention of the first woman on Earth. Eve looked over at the ghost of Adam as he turned left to look at her from the passenger seat of Michael's four-door hatchback. All four of them wondered if the memory of this drive would be the last they would share or if it would be the first. In Michael's voice, and during that same glance the two ghosts gave each other, Michael asked Rose, "is that your real name or did you just know what I would be looking for?" The smile that Rose and Eve wore turned into a sarcastic frown, but they all kinda forgot the respose because they all felt the answer and that was enough.  

. . .

She asked about what he thought about himself at this point in their adventure. In stride she knew and he knew too. There were two answers she liked for that question often asked for the sake of both of them during nights like these. Michael was feeling in the mood so he took her bait and began describing how his creativity was part himself, part inspiration from God, and part _her_.

They both imagined that art is the primal form of man, but who whispered that to whom? Their ninety-nine percent certainty was enough for them both. Their night followed them home by moon and by the rhythm of their march both ways all ways.


. . .


Emotional intellect was the telescope she found _http_ packets - the data Adam liked to send through the web.

She aimed off the reflection of the sea and could feel the center of refraction like the adjustment for the delay on a stereo system signaling a satellite speaker.

Michael is reasonable preference and seasonable emotion is Eve. The moon and the sun are two on the surface of their existence. Deeper, on the other side, is this turn. This turn is a documented objective model named, Adam, in the English translation of Genesis.

Michael and Eve occupy the same space. To create life breathing for life is to create love breathing for love. If after life minus love is still life, then the grammatical intersection equals l & e. The inverse intersection is i-f & o-v.

If an inverse intersection and its intersection are reflective or a reflection, then life resembles functional programming more than I imagined. That realization feels like a shifting transmission and shifting a transmission. That realization feels like the flex of a bicycle frame.

Love minus zero divided by infinity feels like to be redundantly unhalved the other way and how I would explain it to myself at five orbits around the sun. That is basically how Cain described his reality to Abel, but maybe that is basically how Abel described his reality to Cain. They got this from Eve. One day she described this to Adam and it lived like this.

. . .

Eve read _his & her record-paper_ scratched onto the table where Adam sits and she wondered if her kids would always prefer one chair in life as well as learning. In the same moment she recalled Adam joking about this with her and that was just the way he liked to flirt with her. It was a "_working_ title" he would emphasize, "you know what I am saying, a figure of speech", he completed in English and in the memory of Eve. She rolled her eyes because she saw their future. The reason - its all hers. At least three: spades & clubs or diamonds. The future imagination of Eve, had _inside_ jokes the _other_ way. This was how she flirted back. When the product of 2020 and 2 spun them into Santa Monica, that year after death in high definition, she sun-gazed after the image in God from opposing corners of the table.

Eve sketched, "we are running out of shit" on the surface of her jet-black address book.
