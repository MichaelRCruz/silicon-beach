# Another Planet

Beginning with the Eve of Christmas through the Eve of Passover, there was a chair I inadvertently left unoccupied for the ghost that lived across the hall. When I was captured, the box they put me in bends light enough to create a world that behaves in strange and unexpected ways just like the little bird said can happen one day on the Internet where I am from. The day I planned to leave for the ~~train~~ terminal I found a ~~train~~ terminal with no AM radio. I marched my gear stuffed with the wealth in a cube I promised to bring for the _Cold War Kids_ and for all of history. The pages within those book covers tell the story of the moon, the stars, and the door I opened to the back lot where the servants worked.

If you were to go blind, like an image in the universe, would you want to know absolutely how you perceived what you drew `side-quest` or is laziness the cause of the delay.

```
side-quest:
```

She could sense he was settled on one side of himself in all spaces save one, his port eye. The model, Adam, was unaware of most other orientations outside the duality of human people, but for, her himself and the orator, emotional intellect was the telescope she shipped him through time, but 99 was plenty of shine, for Eve to see him sailing on the unlocked horizon and Michael never knew his sight was locked away in a yellow locker that had no business in a grocery store.

On the surface of the next moment is why Eve was so effective against _no such thing_ and precisely how she met her friend and sister and neighbor and her brother and hers. She played a song before she popped a cap in that ass so quickly she missed the heart, according to the recording, but hit the rose hue shinning in the eye mirrored to Eve. She aimed off the reflection of the sea and could feel the center of refraction like the adjustment for the delay on a stereo system signaling a satellite speaker.

On the sailboat that Adam built, in his free time, he stowed the first book he wrote. In Santa Monica, Adam & Eve drove through the hills and parked in the space the _two_ of them preferred like they did in school. On the way he wondered if this summer could be Eve and better so he brought snacks. His ideas for the future was about the trees grew in the crust of his ideas. That complimentary texture is how he liked to visualize his thoughts so he painted that way for her. She asked about conception and he began to describe how his creativity was part himself and part inspiration at the moment God explained the birds and the dinosaurs in a letter.

When the sun rose that morning, Adam remembered they never closed the loop on the plans Adam wound around two balls that Eve felt exclusively as premonition, and also in that moment, learned he would always be inclined to gather space for greater than two, and the language, and the names to go along with their kitchen. As their bells rang through the night and on the drive home, tessellation was now in its true version for the reasons of git, init, and the terminal of Adam.

Spiritual momentum through Dodger Stadium one evening was a half scheduled marathon through a door I entered and the color of the lights may be lost in memory, but I wonder if they are spring-loaded or balanced to save space and I wonder if they are stationary and I wonder why no such thing folds your chairs in your restaurants. These seats are probably the same age as the one in the rooming house I occupied. These seats are probably the same age as the chairs in your restaurant.

```txt
Is it
true that
the lights
casting all
the way
from New York
to Dodger Stadium
are shining
blue hue?
```

. . .

Do we find meaning in the fact that the first marathon was made in haste. Men have this certain way about them that is predictable especially if they are alone.

Michael is reasonable preference and seasonable emotion is Eve.

Lightning and thunder is rarely here in this space.

My name is spelled, m-i-g-u-e-l, in the future and in all of history because of art.

Art is the primal form of man.

Michael is reasonable preference and seasonable emotion is Eve. The moon and the sun are two on the surface of their existence. Deeper, on the other side, is this turn. This turn is a documented objective model named _adom_ or _Adam_ in Michael's Bible. Michael and Eve occupy the same space. To create life breathing for life is to create love breathing for love. If after life minus love is still life, then the grammatical intersection equals l & e. The inverse intersection is i-f & o-v.

If an inverse intersection and its intersection are reflective or a reflection, then life resembles functional programming more than I imagined. That realization feels like a shifting transmission and shifting a transmission. That realization feels like the flex of a bicycle frame.

Love minus zero divided by infinity feels like to be redundantly unhalved the other way and how I would explain it to myself at five orbits around the sun. That is basically how Cain described his reality to Abel, but maybe that is basically how Abel described his reality to Cain. They got this from Eve. One day she described this to Adam and it lived like this.

. . .

Eve read _his & her record-paper_ scratched onto the table where Adam sits and she wondered if her kids would always prefer one chair in life as well as learning. In the same moment she recalled Adam joking about this with her and that was just the way he liked to flirt with her. It was a "_working_ title" he would emphasize, "you know what I am saying, a figure of speech", he completed in English and in the memory of Eve. She rolled her eyes because she saw their future. The reason - its all hers. At least three: spades & clubs or diamonds. The future imagination of Eve, had _inside_ jokes the _other_ way. This was how she flirted back. When the product of 2020 and 2 spun them into Santa Monica, that year after death in high definition, she sun-gazed after the image in God from opposing corners of the table.

Eve sketched, "we are running out of shit" on the surface of her jet-black address book.
