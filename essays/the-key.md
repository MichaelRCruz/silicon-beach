# The Key

One day, this key looked different. This key fit different. This key felt different. This key is different. For myself, all is different. If my key and myself were a paired representation, guess the difference maker. If you guessed that _the key_ was the difference maker, then will you draw what you see? If you guessed that _I_ was the difference maker, then will you draw what you see? If you guessed _no such thing_ was the difference maker, then will I draw what I see? The answer is yes, but are you still watching a paired representation of this key and myself or are you still watching this key and myself?
