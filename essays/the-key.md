# The Key

There is a key that I wear on my left hand that showed me this pattern. Some days I look at my hands. I look at my legs. I look at my feet. I look at my teeth. I look at my elbows. I look at my lungs. I look at my shoulders. I look at my nostrils. I look at ears. I look at my thumbs. I look at my knee caps. I look at my arms. I look again at my hands and I see art. Why am I allowed to see the intention of our creator more than I could yesterday? I ask myself this, but slowly I am learning why. An example of how I found this pattern lives like this.
