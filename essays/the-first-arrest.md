# The First Arrest

Perhaps I have looked into the eyes of evil once before, but it was everywhere in Madison. This story story with the scene where I started narrating my own story. After driving around the capital building once or twice there were a few cars parked a way that made sense to me so I parked next to them. I was so upset about the 9-1-1 call that I found relief in a moment when I backed my car up to the steps of the capital building and laid it out for all of you bad guys. There was temptation to get out of my car, or listen to music, but I just started telling it like it was. If anyone gave it up, it was the city where I went to college. I left for California and three years later the place was as if they were waiting for me to leave.

As best as I can remember, this all happened on one night. The day was spent in the library on the shore of Lake Mendota. Helen C. White was the name of the building, but we called it College Library. On the second floor, and also the third, maybe the fourth, there are large windows that let you look over the lake. If you were early enough, you could sit next to one of them as you studied. The lighting is good and the second floor even has a computer lab. I worked out of that library and my car for a few weeks, but to do so was as difficult because they made it that way.

On the way to the gas station I drove by the desk I leased out of the co-working space on West Washington Ave. This is a few blocks down from Capital Square. This was winter. This was the co-location center for AT&T and this was across the street from a tech company called Info Sec. The city now had this conservative tech vibe.

At the gas station I was confused by the apparent event that was happening across the street from my office. A few people in tuxedos got out of their cars for gas when the event let out. I watched them as they entered the store, got what they needed and left. A few people stayed as if they were waiting with me for the crowd to disperse. A gentleman in a vehicle parked along the side of the lot and away from the pumps got my attention. In fact, I think I asked him for a cigarette. He gave me two. We smoked one together and I asked him what was going on with the event. I asked him in a way that told him I was concerned. He seemed to really know, but did not have the place to tell me. We talked some more and he gave me a bible verse to read. I lost the piece of paper I wrote it down on. In particular, I complained about how much different that bar, Mickeys, felt as an example of why I thought everything changed.

Later that night I was there and I can remember trying as hard as possible to fit in and pretend it was all just a dream. At the library that day, I had to decide what was the truth based on the way my permissions were set with my wisc.edu account. Why do I even still have an active .edu email anyways. The Microsoft License looks legit by its description regarding alumni status or something. The University of Wisconsin-Madison sent me an email informing me of a nomination for a grant and some prestiges recognition. According to the University, the email was a mistake. I did not believe them. The chancellor got her hand-written note with my phone numbers delivered by myself regarding the mistaken email. I looked into it more and found out that I was able to create a position for myself at the university and the vibe I got from the user interface was that it was encouraged. Prior to that I did not know if I had missed an email from one of the jobs at the school I applied for. There was an insurance policy number. There was form templates for taxes. I filled out a few of the forms and. because of the awarded grant, I thought I suddenly was an employee. In the middle of all this my identity was being stolen so I thought this was a way the university was handling it. I was worried it was the weekend.

After learning this was a mistake, I talked with the insurance rep that I made a claim with and she was interested how this happened. The most confusing thing she left me with was that she said they did not have a policy with the University of any kind. That really threw me, but what almost knocked me out was when the guy at the bar sat next to me, introduced himself, and said he just got a job at the university. Kids, is this a good guy or a bad guy? We talked a bunch and went out back for a smoke. He had some weed. We smoked that too. I got really high and he reminded me it was from California. He seemed to know exactly what was happening to me and said they were pissed that I got over their wall. I asked if it was because of curl and he said yes.

The bartender knew I was high and refused me another beer. I pouted in the corner when it seemed someone threw my Thinkpad on the table and somehow they got it out of my car. I picked it up, the battery fell out and that is when I wondered how integrated, with radio, all our devices were. I left the bar and told the bartender to fuck off by writing "netstat" on the bar napkin as I left.
