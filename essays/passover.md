Joshua 10:12-14

On the day the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the Lord in the presence of Israel.
  "O sun, stand still over Gibeon,
    O moon, over the valley of Ajalon"
So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies,

as it is written in the book of Jashar.

  The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going
down about a full day. There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the Lord listened to a man. Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel.
