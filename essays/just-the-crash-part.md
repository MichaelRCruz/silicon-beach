# Just the Crash Part

Lights appeared in the dashboard of that vehicle and then I became tired. I became tired and then lights appeared on the dashboard. I knew that was all for me because I was falling asleep. Do you know how polite it was for me to tell you now, as opposed to the first time when enough details were there. This one will sting. I did not pull over because the thought of me sleeping in my car on the side of the road was scarier than possible death. In other words, somehoe I knew I was not going to make it to the next exit so I tried.

Those lights in the dash, though. That medication from the telebot. This was prod though. Preprod was the phone call in my friend's garage. I know it was not my real doxtor because I had to tell you all the details and you knew i \\I would.

Beyond that, I do not think I have a nephew. I could list them off, but if you know you know.

I will list off my demands.
