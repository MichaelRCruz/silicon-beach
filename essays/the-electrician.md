# The Electrician & The Waitress

One day, I was at a nice restaurant in Chicago and this cute waitress waited on my table and also seemed to be waiting for me to arrive. It was late and, these days, everything closes early, so, when I got there I asked when they were closing. She said not to worry about it even though it seemed like they were supposed to be closed already. She was not wearing a mask. She was nice to be in this genuine way and that was a significant moment in my life.

Often, I would say she was the nicest anyone has been to me since I can remember and that is why I thought she liked me. To find out, I left my broken watch on the restaurant table the next time I was there. She waited on me, but this time she was wearing a mask. The chemistry was different because she was either trying to tell me something or she was worried about something. I paid and left my phone email and watch for her to contact me if she thought there was anything there.

The last time I saw her was my attempt to ask her out, but since the bartender noticed I was not wearing a mask, I never sat at her bar and I never asked her on that date. After returning to the restaurant everyday, even if it was me skating by to look for her, I finally asked one of her coworkers when she would be around and I asked him what her name was. He told me, but one month later, I called the restaurant, she answered and said she knew nothing about a watch. That was my clue so I moved on.

Another significant moment for me, like the one in Chicago minus the romance, was the favor a Los Angeles Electrical Engineer did for me on the subway. He left, on the stairs, the documentation I needed to understand the world I lived in. It was some of the course work he completed in college and I am eternally thankful for the examples and practice problems he shared with me that he used to study for his exams. He sat next to me while I was talking with another passenger waiting for the train, but was in the corner of my vision. He looked like he had something on his mind and I noticed, but realized what was on his mind when I found his coursework on the stairs of the subway.

If you and your family are reading this, then I get to say in front of the world, God bless you and your family forever. Even if I fail to understand the study material, what you did for me was the most love I have experienced in a few years. This might seem a little exaggerated, but I am without a family and I am without any friends and that should help everyone understand just how much that meant to me. Thanks, my dude. You would be amazing to work with. I appreciate the faith you have in God because I would not have noticed any other way.
