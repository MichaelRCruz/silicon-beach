# The Cokd War && The Cold Warriors

There is so much I can say about drugs, but you will find that _speaking from experience_ means no such thing to every kid in all of history. There is more about drugs than I will ever know. You all know I have done every _street_ drug except for one: methamfedamine. There was fortune I found in my life. East of the Mississippi, where I supposedly spent most of my life, had a different problem - opiates. The first one I tried was hydrocodone or hydrocodine. These chemicals were meant to alleviate pain. They do. They did. They can. They cannot. Rather than remove pain, opiates remove anxiety. Opiates removed _all_ anxieties of mine. This is not a justification nor is this a warrant for social arrest. My testimony, regarding the war on drugs lives like this.

If they are teaching you that Marijuana is a _gateway drug_, then they are correct, but get that out of your schools, please, because that it takes two to conspire. After a drug-abuse resistance education, what will kids be like? After two police people in uniform, or in costume, finished my indoctrination about drugs, that school day, I got hooked on heroin at eighteen and got unhooked at twenty-two. No relapse, ever. Not even close!

There was something odd about their disseminatiuon of information. Nobody cared about what they had to say until they _had_ to say it.
