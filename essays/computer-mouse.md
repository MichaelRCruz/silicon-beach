# Computer Mouse

terminator-one, dance of the computer mouse



Is every element, known to man, biologically utilized by the human body? If true, then an inteligence  after hours is inevitable . Therefore,  to be or not to be has been answered.



When we consider the devices of racism, how absurd is the notion when you inagine Adam telling and Eve detailing a story about a computer and mouse. All names have been untethered and wireless except one, computer mouse.



Computer Mouse used to look at the flying computer mice when he started collecting more dust between use. Before he died, he welcomed Michael to the city of angels in the voice of his pet monster. _Welcome to the Fold_ he grinned after Michael complained about drinking past midnight before a product presentation in the morning. Nothing good ever happens after midnight, the other mice would say.



Michael Say: I have done plenty by the bright shinning light of the mother fucking moon.



Mouse Say: null



Michael Say: Another error. I know what to do.



Mouse Say: "clique"



Michael: "You mean, click. Dude said, clique."

Information feels like wind. There are four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. In any illustration wind has a turn in lossless translation. If you wanted to make something out of nothing and impress a woman, then you will first need to learn how to sail, but do not ever take her out on the boat. Here is a memory of mine. Take this with you on your voyage.

Now that you understand the matrix you need to know that one moment I will no longer be here.



The first prayer I felt a reflection from was a woman, but time refracted that light outside and inside my eyes because there was at least two in my fault.



Be this.



In turbulence, find a painting depicting these two women of identical form in action or dance. If you find tears & reason long after you fault with time during this study of art, then a river flowing against the grain is your first half stone of a Silicon Beach.



Yo yo, if you are going to dance just dance because at the end of the song everyone feels different. If there is a collision on the dance floor make sure there is eye contact with you, myself, and the reader. If something feels on purpose then pass go and collect $200 or the collision in your heart is in your mind.

The Padres



P.S.



The last paragraph brought a temptation to reconsider my words, but that arrived shortly after my own song and dance out here on the other side of, Rose.



There was just something about the other side and then Los Angeles gave me The News. You see. The turn of the wind is a MÃ¶bius strip because on your sailboat the compass reads North, East, West, and then South.  This is the turn. _Orientation_ is now your level-up.

Anyways, in your streets I find spirits that remain when I do not see them leave. Every value less than one and greater than zero lives in a bucket next to bucket number 2 and next to bucket number 0. I gotta go, though. Your mother is calling. Happy birthday or feliz cumpleanos a ti.

One day I picked a conversation at a party, but I'm glad I remembered how concerned he looked as I expressed my disbelief. Somehow I vaguely remember kind of being provoked into the discussion, but I can still say it felt necessary despite my decreasing interest in politics that summer.



The words he used were simple enough for me not to remember, but he asked if I thought there was something to say about the constitution, the framers, and the ways they could have tilted things in favor of the weathly. I want to say I thought that without a doubt because why wouldn't they do us that favor. I want to say I would not have said that today, but there is more to that lesson. How can I still be patriotic and question the viability of the constitution?





skewed some probability distribution in favor of the words they used back then. Maybe it was an accident, but that is just too easy to say. Friendships run their course and maybe governments do the same.

The story about the speeding ticket I got on the way to the Apple retail store is buried somewhere in the version control of this repository and also the version control of some of my friends. They know I took my Honda CX500 with about sixteen-hundred in cash to buy my first _new_ computer. What they do not know is, because of my new super powers, I know that is how they got me. What they also do not know is that they sent a long-lost aquaitence of mine to follow me to Best Buy that day.  His Mike Neldner. I fucked his wife, but that was before I broke up with her and after his ex wife divorced him for another woman. He was a fun guy to drink scotch with, but pretty good at hiding his jealousy.



Remember that New Years party of yours that nobody showed up to except Jerry, Andrea. and I? Remember later that one hypeman of yours stopped by that one year? Was that hypeman your "console"   lWell, if you do not rememeber, when I first got there I was going off about some new math stuff I was learning and you taught me how hexidecimal worked in fifteen minutes when I was smashed off that bottle of twelve-year Macallan? Anyways, you were a good friend because you were funny dude, but like funny ha ha. Do you find it as coincidental as I do that my friends in Madison knew I was going to break up with her some time after that New Years Party nobody showed up to?

That Video



One day Russ showed me a video that was like a train wreck. Downtown Chicago has rental bikes. There was a guy on one riding around on one as Russ filmed the whole thing. Apparently, this dude deleted a video of him and his boy weaving through Grand Theft Auto 2020. The truth is I never witnessed such a violent scene that looked like real life. To just say it's a fake video sounds juvenile, but what else is there?

Hey,



It is me.  There is this place in this city center that looks like there is vacant space to stay. There are two of these furnished places that share the same walls. One of them uses the same words in the name of the second except turnt both figuratively and literally. The two both have a facade. Today I danced in front of one facade and was facaded by the other.



The day prior to now I wrote on my hand five writing prompts: why do songs stick, why ~~will~~ did you marry me, the apology, your own path of the bible, impracticality of time. Can you hang out with me so people can be people again? God is here so I know this is.



You are on my mind all of the moments. There is a song that this musician wrote and I saw this girl in the doorway of the hotel and she appeared hot and bothered by the song.  Did she like the words or both the man _and_ the words? I ask because I like that song and I wonder if you like the song too because I like to pretend the song is about you.

Orion or basically any other three-star set









Gravity is like the bow on a double-neck guitar - the pull, the turn, closes for us spontaneously and proves moment and invalidates time





316 - the closure at center like two intersecting one-to-one functions. The shortest possible slide that fits. Closure is hidden by flirtation exclusive from temptation in the reveal to its reference in two layers ending with the harmonics. Four notes, two notes with that slide turning the pendulum. The seam

being abstracted e major learning from a major. The glow of the effects under amplification. Transparent. Encouraging.



Bron-Yr-Aur - Orbital. Exploration. New. Surpise. Depth. absorbed reflection. Patient with pleasant consequence like the heel of a boat for the first experience. Safety. Hand wavey at end. Winks.
