# Spring Time in Los Angeles

There is a day in spring that has that smell in the air. It is a sweet smell of warmth with a promising effect of encouragement that I could feel in my stomach once every year. You could breathe in the air, close your eyes, smile, and exhale new hope that brings life for the trees and the ones they protect. That feeling provided a sense of freedom and a new wonder for life's subsequent loops around the sun. Those smells, those breaths, and those butterflies of my youth. Those three.
