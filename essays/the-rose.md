# The Rose

There seems to be a **termination** obtainable for some objects. For others, the volumes of these objects seem to approach infinity. The visualization is quite illuminating if you can imagine a pair of dice. One of them carve to a perfect sphere, and the other, leave as is if and only if cubed. Reverse one of your observations, like you would with camera film, and we are back to the cube. The inverse space, that was removed with a carving blade, could represent the Earth. This may take a few tries before you can activate your imagination this way, but the surfaces of the cube is your grid of satellites like lint on a pair of yoga pants.

When you reach the point of no return you will be able to loop this transformation from a cube to a sphere easily. Try, though, with other shapes like a pyramid. This practice should set the mood for how you might need to design your framework for our time-travel experiment. If you can visualize a _cub-ed_ linear growth pattern, then you can visualize a _pyramid-ed_ linear growth pattern. The cubed flavor approaches infinity in five potential vectors. The three-sided pyramid has three potential vectors.  They live like this.

A cube and a four-sided pyramid need an orientation because of gravity and also because of perception. The base of each do not count.

If you compare a cube and a three-sided pyramid, then the way a physics engine might render an object inside bouncing forever should reveal something about life. How many places would the object bounce to no other place? For example, a cube has four places across the corners and the rest make up the infinite amount of places the other ways it bounced. Another example is the three-sided pyramid. An object shaped like that has four places of eternal bounce and that is all. If a cube and a three-sided pyramid where built along side one another, you could tip both of them over and the majority of the objects stay in the cube and the pyramid loses all of them.

If this makes a cube the better building material, then consider their processing patters. The rules are you can stack the cubes and pyramids together, but according their own shape, then have the allowance of cloning the triangle or the square of each side, render that down one unit of measurement and that is how your pattern of process draws what you see.

Could you build a rose with the pyramids and curl the leaf at the tip? Are plant cells cubed? What if the sticks used to build both the pyramid and the cube where all the same length? Could you curl a rose pedal then?

One day I laid back and played with my flashlight and pretended to be a Pharaoh that hung out in the pyramid that was given to me. I laid there with my flashlight and watched the shadows bend off the ceiling and felt like I was actually there. I was alone and there was a light and there was also someone there too. I felt bad about how everyone felt about me, but the ones that took care of me told you who I was before I could. Was there someone else with me in that pyramid because it felt amazing for a moment?
