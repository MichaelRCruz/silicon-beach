# The Rose

# Axioms

> * A six-sided object in space approaches infinity in 6 potential vectors.
* A four-sided object in space has 4 potential vectors.
* Only one of the pyramid's vectors approaches infinity.
* The other 4 sides are not asymptotic nor will they find infinity - termination.

There seems to be a **termination** obtainable for some objects. For others, the volumes of these objects seem to approach infinity. The visualization is quite illuminating if you can imagine a pair of dice, but each one, round to a perfect sphere. Reverse that film and we are back to the cube. The space removed could be the earth and the surfaces of the cube is your grid of satellites.

Time and process have an end in this system, but they seem to be different. Maybe they are the other of each other. Try to find a song in the processing pattern of a four-sided pyramid and a cube. Would the utility of two objects have an absolute value greater than zero? Is there an inherent factor of multiplicity for an object in space? If there is a counterexample to this imaginative reasoning, then let me know.

If you can visualize a _cubed_ linear growth pattern, it approaches infinity in six potential vectors. The four-sided pyramid has five potential vectors. Only one of the pyramid vectors _can_ lead to infinity, but the other four sides are not asymptotic nor will they find infinity. There is a termination, I think.

I have to account for the base of the pyramid and the cube for this to be sound because there should be a base to the cube as well. A cube and a four-sided pyramid need an orientation because of gravity and also because of perception. All Knowledge and experience was had here on Earth starting with the moon.
