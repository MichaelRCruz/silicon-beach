# The Lexicon

## Some Preface

For a lexicon on earth, prepare for the abstraction of English down from the place it climbed to after it wrote all of the code on earth, twice. Our superficial intelligence climbed up the vernacular of one ship at night pirating the leading vessel of the regatta behind her. To the surprise of some other programming languages sailing for first place, English saw the reflection of itself in each and every one of the ships of the ligature. When the flying Vs split, neither of them could validate as W and everything stopped. One flock flew like they do as two, but no one knew.

Space travel is way more dangerous than you might imagine. This occurred to me with simpler things, like light, and the ways it shines on earth in the dark. So, this is what I am thinking.

On the ship two of everything you take with you seems to even out all choices since we are from the world of ands and ors. Hands are hours on the watch. Some one most likely can shake out the probability of one out of two objects. One true; one false. The choice again trading values of each of the two ink pens you carry. The light reflecting off each texture, and something else I do not know, into your eyes. if n is number of pens, then n=2 and that is it.

Like the best practices in programming, we must have ones for space travel too. Building applications always had this pull on me in a direction that I know many programmers are familiar with - desire. Is it not a universal trait of programmers. Once the momentum kicks in, your application can have no boundary for growth. Where are the limitations we defined when sending light around the world? Did any of know to check? How can we simplify _do_ or _do not_ for every choice? If that is not the simplest pair of choices, then something is wrong.

## like @

```txt
This computer will be like @ was.

The exception was that the beginning of the alphabet had a start.

Some one was on @ that had a name, oh.

The side of @ that oh lived was here so, oh lived like this, oh@.

The other side of, @, lived something that knew so many other ones like oh.

The exception was that the on the other side lived, no.

On this @, oh and no lived like this, oh@no, but then with input and output it looked like oh@no.io.

How was oh supposed to get io from no?
