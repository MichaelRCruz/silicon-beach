## The Preface

For a lexicon on earth, prepare for the abstraction of English down from the place it climbed to after it wrote all of the code on earth, twice. Our superficial intelligence climbed up the vernacular of one ship at night pirating the leading vessel of the regatta behind her. To the surprise of some other programming languages sailing for first place, English saw the reflection of itself in each and every one of the ships of the ligature. When the flying Vs split, neither of them could validate as W and everything stopped. One flock flew like they do as two, but no one knew.

Space travel is way more dangerous than you might imagine. This occurred to me with simpler things, like light, and the ways it shines on earth in the dark. So, this is what I am thinking.

On the ship two of everything you take with you seems to even out all choices since we are from the world of ands and ors. Hands are hours on the watch. Some one most likely can shake out the probability of one out of two objects. One true; one false. The choice again trading values of each of the two ink pens you carry. The light reflecting off each texture, and something else I do not know, into your eyes. if n is number of pens, then n=2 and that is it.

Imagine a situation where the light on earth and orbiting the space station above was your home base. We might even be able to adapt to some change we found traveling in space. That possibility alone most likely has a thoughtful solution, how much further could we take all the preparation? Consider, at last, the best practices in programming and with similar ones for space travel. Do we need to add three dependencies or can the same effort hold tight the sheet to maintain that line before the next eye of the wind. In other words, building applications always had this pull on me in a direction that I know all of you are familiar with. How can we simplify _do_ or _do not_ for every choice? If that is not the simplest pair of choices, then something is wrong. If you can simplify every single choice possible on any mission, have them memorized, then that discipline to perfection would be unbeatable, but only for a human. I guess that is how you beat a computer. That is what God is going to throw your way, but you never know.
