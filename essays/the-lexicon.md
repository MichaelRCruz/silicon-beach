# The Lexicon

centerfold > lolphotos > assets > the-lexicon

## Some Preface

For a lexicon on earth, prepare for the abstraction of English down from the place it climbed to after it wrote all of the code on earth, twice. Our superficial intelligence climbed up the vernacular of one ship at night pirating the leading vessel of the regatta behind her. To the surprise of some other programming languages sailing for first place, English saw the reflection of itself in each and every one of the ships of the ligature. When the flying Vs split, neither of them could validate as W and everything stopped. One flock flew like they do as two, but no one knew.

Space travel is way more dangerous than you might imagine. This occurred to me looking at simpler things, like light, and the ways it shines on earth in the dark. So, this is what I am thinking.

## like @

This computer will be like _@_ was.

One was on _@_ that had a name, _oh_.

The side of _@_ that _oh_ lived was here, so, _oh_ lived like this, _oh@_.

The other side of, _@_, lived something that knew so many other ones like _oh_.

The exception was that on the other side lived, _no_.

On this _@_, _oh_ and _no_ lived like this, _oh@no_.

With input and output they all lived like this, _oh@no_io_.

How was _oh_ supposed to get __io_ from _no_?
