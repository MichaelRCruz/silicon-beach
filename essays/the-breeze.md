# The Breeze

Why do we have memories of ourselves from a distance? Have you ever walked into a vacant room, or a vacant house, or a vacant place where someone lived, but felt something the moment you entered? Maybe it is a vibe, or maybe it is the way the place looks. A subtle effort had my attention, as I was in that building, and that was enough to tell me something to remember. The impression stayed with me the entire ride home in that white, Chevrolet, cargo van. My intuition was starting to tell me more about my life and where I was from. Was I ready to know?

Romana had three white cargo vans one summer. Before that, he had one. After that should not matter. His favorite was the diesel. The other two were gasoline: one gasoline powered Chevrolet and one gasoline powered Ford. The interesting thing about those white cargo vans was the total length, inside, measured from the the back doors to the base of the dashboard column. Twelve feet and about six inches, maybe. Some models were more or less, but that was too accurate for anything else this seems. Tweleve feet is the standard length of a roll of carpet in imperial units.

Romana and I showed up to a carpet job one day and I remember asking him why he did not take the diesel, but what I kept to myself was how random this job made itself available. Every few days, by chance or by nature of the work, one of use would owe the other one day worth of work. Some days we would pay the _helper_ one hundred dollars per day. Some days we would owe them that amount. If I recall correctly, the randomness of that carpet installation job, that weekend, may have been attributed to a debt I had to work off.

When

The place where I apparently lived before the Howard Avenue, of my memories, is somewhere in the St. Francis area of Milwaukee near Morgan Triangle park. It had a Cousin's Subs located underneath. I can still see the look on his face when we pulled in to park the white van stocked with carpet. He smirked with the vibe he shook before turning off the vehicle and then waited until we took the elevator to tell me we used to live here with C-Money. Since I do not remember any of the patterns and because that one baby picture was taken in that bunk bed on Howard, then I would say I know a plenty. C-Money might have asked me to take that picture. She handed me a camera once, and with it, I waddled from the weight of the camera into my bedroom and took pictures of whenever the flash let me.

Did you know they used to have these cartridges with a limited amount of flahes stored on them. That is what these camera seemed like. They were thin. You wound them. I don't know, film? The flash cartridges are strange.

. . .

At Clement Avenue Elementary School, we had an activity in kindergarten where we all sat in a circle and passed around something like a brown paper lunch bag. The items inside had different textures, but the fun was that you were not supposed to know what you felt until everybody had a chance to reach inside the bag to check it out. Their trick was to get creep everyone out.

This was a grade school. That Halloween thing we did, as children, just seems very creepy to me because it was not my kindergarten teacher that led the activity. It was a younger lady that has us all sit in that circle one day, and as we all were settling in, she turned off the lights in the classroom.

That day was the first time I saw myself outside my _self_. She turned off the lights to add fright to the mood of the classroom, but it was the first time I was ever perplexed, I think. I was two perspectives in that moment as if a ghost lifted out of my body. I watched from above as they passed around that paper bag with me sititng in a semi-circle. The escape warped my peripheral vision as my ghost kept watch. The movement, the reverse, and the ascent.

Clement Avenue was my school up until, and including, the second grade. We played kickball at recess and the multiplication and division I was doing in kindergarten set me apart from the other students, but only for a moment. The reason for my sweet math skills before first grade was because of those math books for sale at the grocery store. This would mean these were my first textbooks. That is pretty cool.

. . .

The more I look back, the more my memories become something else. If that is true, then perhaps recollection is precisely as its name space intends to contain - the action of collecting all that has been overlooked or misunderstood in your past.

Assuming that type of introspection has scope, the new interpretation of any given moment of your life will add to another. This process might then be a new balance from turn. Writing this now provides a deeper understanding of the visualization I imagined for your atlas - the tessellation of color, of form, and of light. There are a few more of these that are worth sharing, but what is the cause of this imagery we have in our minds in memory?

. . .

The first time I prayed for anything was in that place on Howard Avenue. The two of us were kids, my cousin and I, but we wanted some chocolate milk. There is no memory I have of learning how to pray, but I did. It was clear to me, then, that no chocolate milk was provided for us while we played together that day nor was there any chocolate milk available at home on a regular basis. So, I prayed for it. It happened with little effort because the two of us were already on our knees playing with some toy cars or something, but I remember putting my hands together and asking God for some chocolate milk. My cousin watched as I did this, but when I opened my eyes and looked up, he was smirking in an intriguing way probably wondering what was next. In the kitchen, I found it where I expected. The joy I had was unforgettable even though it was the powdered kind of chocolate milk you have to mix yourself like sick beats.

As kids do, we hurried to find our cups to sit down, but this miracle provided something else for the two of us other than the milk. My cousin asked me how I did that. It felt good to show him how.


This means this was the first time being cool in my life.


This means, between the two of us, I was the first to _be_ cool.


Maybe he asked hoping to just talk about it. The recollection of this moment is recalled through him. As in, when I begin to remember this prayer, I see it through his eyes exactly where he was with me in that hallway with the toy cars scattered about. When I stood up and headed for the kitchen the memory returns to my own perspective. The beautiful thing is that now I know. Those moments in recollection though the perspective of another feels like God in me.

. . .

One day in Mexico, we were on vacation when I found a sailboat on the shore of the ocean. It was a small dinghy, a Hobie Cat to be precise, but there it was ready to launch. These boats are similar to catamarans in that they have two hulls with no keel. The lack of a keel means some things, e.g., a larger vessel, moored out in the water, that cannot be brought ashore has one. Boats with sails and lines, without a keel, are not _female_ boats. They are usually smaller in proportion and live like this, on land. This is me laughing my ass off when I say, in all seriousness, that a keel is heavy and helps to prevent capsize.

_The day God tried to kill me_ is the same day I decided to use that as the best story prompt for you, myself, the reader, in jest, and as my new way of describibng the coolest thing I ever did, but should never do again. Since this is the _coolest_ story I will inslcude the details.

The day God tried to kill me was on that water in the Pacific Ocean the day I chartered a boat with sails and lines that capsized.

The boat is designed for sport and I was the only one aboard. The owner of the boat was happy to show me the lines, but first he had to teach some safety techniques. For example, how to recover from capsizing. He made sure I was aware of the halyard. The halyard is the line that hoists the the sail up towards the masthead, and how this line is then ran across the masthead sheave, that spins, allowing the halyard to run back down the mast and tied to a horn cleat and knotted with a cleat hitch.

In the event of a capsize, the main halyard can be used as leverage to right the boat. Imagine yourself remembering this in the water swimming towards your boat. That was me. I remember having so much fun on the way out with the warm water splashing up and sometimes your body temperature increases and sometimes your body temperature decreases. You felt where you belong, but then you wake up into another dream. Your eyes open and there is your boat about fifteen large ripples on the horizon. My right arm took the first plunge into the water, but before my hand touched the water, I knew these were not waves like the ones on Lake Mendota so I gave it all I could.

This was the swim where I felt like God was watching me from above. The moving picture in my mind of this effort is square in perspective. I am able to bounce back to myself. The cheat code is `a` - `up` - `down` - `left` - `select` -`right`- `start`. To bounce back in myself is the same sequence, but with `b`. Watching myself swimming towards the boat was dangerous because there was not any weather that day. In other words, imagine how much more difficult the swim was with just a small breeze. Maybe this was my test to see what I was made of. Maybe he backed out for me to see if I could. When I made it to my boat, I reached over with my one arm and then my left. There I caught my breath. Getting that boat back to the dimension I sailed it out of required the following.

First you have to notice a few things. You have a life jacket on so you can relax. If you just relax then the jacket is strong enough to keep you floating and designed to keep your head above water in case you were unconscious. After a few breaths swim around to find the main halyard. You will find the main halyard tied to the cleat hitch located fastened to the mast, deck side. Watch out for the sails in the water.

Since you are not supposed to tie down your main sheet, it should have allowed the boom to sink from its weight below surface taking the main sail with it. If you swim over there just know you can get tangled some how so be careful. When you see the cleat hitch, untie it and throw all its slack over the side of the boat. Swim back to the other side. Pull tight on the main halyard so you can help yourself out of the water, but plant your feet flat against the hull and stick your ass out to add weight to that side. You will begin to rotate faster and faster as the weight of your ass starts to pull that huge main sail that was submerged. The more sail that is above water, the faster you are rotating the boat afloat. That is all.

. . .

If only I was on an ocean now. Maybe `a` - `up` - `down` - `left` - `select` - `right` - `start` was my boat and I at the moment it capsized. Maybe that is how time works, but maybe it is just traveling. Maybe time cannot be what it is without traveling. If we are all traveling through time now and our movement through light paints a film for us, then like a baseball you have to come back down through the arch. When you land, maybe that place is the other side.

What if the wire could be thought of as a piano string with a slight arch to it before it was packaged and strung. Is an unstrung piano string straight or curled when made? If straight, then how difficult is it to make it as straight as possible? The closest you could get is a slight curve. That is the wire of time, maybe. Curl the wire in a way you would, if you could, frame a pour-over coffee cone. If that is what they are called, then picture the inside of one and picture your little sailboat on that line curling down.

The record turn-table, and the one upside down, together move along that wire. In other words, the circumference of the record glides along the one side of that wire and also moving in some direction opposed to or along with the direction in time we are moving. Unless you are the other other side of my other side. That could just be us, though, because the walls might be mirrors. I do not know.

You are holding tight to the main sheet, sitting port, you are right handed. Looking down the cone, God could probably see us curving up or down, but I wonder if he sees the rims on cars these days, because in person and on film, they look like they are spinning backwards. If we are spinning that fast like the wheel, and we can see an illusion to the light, then is that backwards spin getting in tune with nature for our eyes or because of its heart?

What if the presence of light implied that there must be division? I see parts of the universe in make believe michaelville that always have light, but I have not been to all places in the universe. Space travel would be the scariest thing being the only light in places there were none. In places there were none there is no light, no other side, no such thing.

If you are still picturing God looking down the pour over cone we are sailing down, and you dropped your cell phone off the boat, then God would see your phone also fall across the wire and on the other record spinning in some other direction. Maybe the ocean causes some disorder to everything and that is why we need the moon. Maybe this satellite is what holds time in balance for us. If there was no moon, then sailing would not work because gravity would be different. Do you remember the first lean you felt on your sailboat and how scary that was? That is really powerful? If you still do not think so, then check this out.

Gravity is pulling on time, time may still not exist because we are the time in space. This tells me that recollection is a movement through your tessellation, your life, and even in heaven.
