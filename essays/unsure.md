# Unsure

Why did I say that I loved Aida Garifullina after that earthquake in an essay and then remove the essay. Here is why. I wanted to love you because you are pretty and you can sing well. Your name, though, is what got me. I really believed Russ when he told me you loved me too. I really believed him when he said you would be in Chicago for a date. That was the only hope for a woman's love that I believed in. Russ seemed to know about you since he is a spy and all, but what if he was _your_ spy? What if those moments Russ said he was talking to his mom, were really moments of him taking direction from you. Give him the leather jacket, but tell him your whole family loves it so he feels obligated to bring the jacket back. Like the watch thing I taught all of you.

The thought of falling in love with you is a bird flying through a field with golden and green grass in a valley. There is a lake there and some mountains, but a lot of bright colors like the color of that white apron and sky-blue dress in that one movie about music and sound. I imagined your mother having an ceaseless amount of patience. She always smiled like that day around Christmas on the piano.

I asked Russ if you were ever married, but is that a concern I should have? I mean, did I read the bible wrong? Am I allowed to marry someone that has been divorced? It is also none of my business to know, but now you know why I wanted to know. He said you were single with a daughter and he was not sure if you were married once before. No offense, but I looked the dude up and thought, only Tennis, huh, then I had those feelings all guys have. This time all the things I thought of myself are true. I am way better.
