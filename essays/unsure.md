# Unsure

Why did I say that I loved Aida? After that earthquake, on a train, in an essay, I said I loved you. I just wanted to because you are pretty. I wanted to love you because you can sing well. I really believed Russ when he told me you loved me too. You were the only women I had a thing for, even though we never met online or in person, that did not occupy my mind to the point of madness.

At the airport, the one with the 4.20 magnitude earthquake, two security guards kicked me out of the airport because I did not have a ticket yet. While we were arguing I asked him if he knew who my girlfriend was in a snotty way. He claimed to not know so I told him it was you and that you are very attractive and that was the only thing I could think of to say. The thought made me feel better. His response was, "she is alright." i could tell he was trolling me, but I wanted to hurt him.

Russ said you would be in Chicago a few days after my train arrived. Why did you not call? Where was I supposed to meet you? Russ seemed to know about you since he is a spy and all, but what if he was _your_ spy and not exactly a KGB agent? If so, what happened? I believed him because I wanted to. That kiss was something I could not accept from you last summer because it felt so cheap. I felt creepy asking Russ to set me up with a kiss from you so that is why I left Chicago. Also, i felt like I deserved that kiss because of the earthquake I caused.

When Russ showed me your picture online, I told him that was the kind of woman I would mover mountains for. The thought of falling in love with you has an image. A bird is flying over a field with golden grass in a valley somewhere in Russia. There is a lake there and some mountains. There are bright colors like the color of that white apron and lite-blue dress in a movie about sound and music. All that imagery may have been from a dream, but that is how I saw _you_ see _us_ after I sent you that message.
