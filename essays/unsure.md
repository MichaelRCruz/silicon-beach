# Unsure

Why did I say that I loved Aida? After that earthquake, on a train, in an essay, I said I loved her. Here is why. I wanted to because you are pretty. I wanted to love you because you can sing well. I really believed Russ when he told me you loved me too. Your name, though, is what got me.

He said you would be in Chicago a few days after my train arrived. Why did you not call? Where was I supposed to meet you? Russ seemed to know about you since he is a spy and all, but what if he was _your_ spy and not exactly a KGB agent? If so, what happened? I believed him because I wanted to, but that kiss was something I could not take from you last summer.

The thought of falling in love with you has an image. A bird is flying over a field with golden grass in a valley somewhere in Russia. There is a lake there and some mountains. There are bright colors like the color of that white apron and lite blue dress in a movie about sound and music. All that imagery may have been from a dream, but that is how I saw _you_ see _us_ after I sent you that message.

...brb if I feel like it
