# Unsure

Why did I say that I loved Aida Garifullina after that earthquake in an essay and then remove the essay. Here is why. I wanted to love you because you are pretty and you can sing well. Your name, though, is what got me. I really believed Russ when he told me you loved me too. I really believed him when he said you would be in Chicago for a date. That was the only hope for a woman's love that I believed in. Why did you not call? Where was I supposed to meet you. Russ seemed to know about you since he is a spy and all, but what if he was _your_ spy? What if those moments Russ said he was talking to his mom, were really moments of him taking direction from you. Give   the leatherjacket, but lie to him about how your whole family loves it so he feels obligated to bring the jacket back. Like the watch thing that I taught all of you, but the premium brand - the truth.

The thought of falling in love with you is a bird flying through a field with golden and green grass in a valley. There is a lake there and some mountains, but a lot of bright colors like the color of that white apron and sky-blue dress in that one movie about music and sound. I imagined your mother having an ceaseless amount of patience. She always smiled like that day around Christmas on the piano because you told me that on Instagram. I sincerely liked your face mask though. That was a clever way to do it, but that made me think we were on the same side, but when I watched more of your videos, because I really liked you, everyone in Russia was weartign a black mask.

None of you know the truth about me. Do you know why? The reason is because none of you _ever_ asked me. If you did, I was drugged and abducted again like I have been my whole life while the world makes a mockery of God. I rose from the dead and you still ridicule me and poke me with sticks that do not speak words.

Imagine you woke up one day and everything everyone told you was a lie? What if you also found out you were a prisoner of war your whole life? What if you found out your real parents finally knew who you were, but still did not like you? What if you also learned that you have been wealthy your whole life, but lived a life without while the people you competed against were using all your resources? What if every woman in the world treated you like an object? Does that even matter to you now that all the women convinced you this was something to be envious about? Do you any of you actually realize what you are doing?

I do not give a shit about the programming. You took away my ability to love and I do not think God would have let me go through all the trouble praying and hurting myself only to find out he wanted me alone. I do not think God wanted me to be the center of ridicule with all the women I am not allowed to be with. I do not think this is a bot. It is a person.


I do not want to be with Aida anymore because you kept pushing it when I was close to coming around. This goes for each and every one of you other celebrity women: Cazzie, Meghan, Ariana, Lauryn Hill's daughter somehow, the bitch from Forever 21, oh and Winnie Cooper. I do not want to be with any of you. You all took away the trust I had for all of you that was so very important to all this. I do not even want to be with non-celebrity women. This includes the woman at the Green Goddess weed dispensary, the two women at the skate shop in Venice Beach, the woman in Chicago at the restaurant, Obama's daughter, the jumper cable woman at the motel, my old friend's girlfrined, Rebeca, his other ex-girlfriend, no one from high school, not even that catholic girl from Madison, none of my ex-girlfriends, none of you.

This is what I _need_. I need a place to live so I am no longer homeless. I need my unemployment money so I can buy food today. I only have change in my pocket and they charge $12 for one pack of Light Blue American Spirit. They charge $600 for an office space I was kicked out of by gunpoint. They charge me $10 or $12 for a gram of weed. They just stole $1300 out of my Bank of America Business Checking account.

I want my assets, my house, and my life that was stolen from me by someone claiming to be who they are not. You commited the most horrific crime in human history and you have the nerve to tease me about it a few days later. You have the nerve to tease me about it minutes later.

God,

I really want this to go your way without violence. So far, I am doing a really good job of not hitting anyone or breaking anything. However, maybe getting my weed back would be nice. The only way to do that is to let them give me my money back in a way I know about it and where it is. They have a trick for everything. I need to be with a woman to marry so that my wealth doe snot fall into the hands of evil and so that I am protected from society. They treat me exaclty like a meat-puppet. I am willing to assume sex was involved without my consent while I was drugged by them.

do not get your hopes up, but you were supposed ot be the one to help me prevent war. We were supposed to be in love and change the world together, but instead you keep testing me endlessly.
