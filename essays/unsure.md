# Unsure

Why did I say that I loved Aida? After that earthquake, on a train, in an essay, I said I loved her. Here is why. I wanted to because you are pretty. I wanted to love you because you can sing well. I really believed Russ when he told me you loved me too. Your name, though, is what got me.

He said you would be in Chicago a few days after my train arrived. Why did you not call? Where was I supposed to meet you? Russ seemed to know about you since he is a spy and all, but what if he was _your_ spy and not exactly a KGB agent? If so, what happened? I believed him because I wanted to, but that kiss was something I could not take from you last summer.

The thought of falling in love with you has an image. A bird is flying over a field with golden grass in a valley somewhere in Russia. There is a lake there and some mountains. There are bright colors like the color of that white apron and sky-blue dress in that one movie about music and sound. Maybe I pictured all that in a dream. Maybe that is how I saw you see us.

This is what I _need_. I need a place to live so I am no longer homeless. I need my unemployment money so I can buy food today. I only have change in my pocket and they charge $12 for one pack of Light Blue American Spirit. They charge $600 for an office space I was kicked-out of by six Pasadena police at gunpoint because I could not complere an ACH payment and you could not complete a cash or credit card payment. I want my assets back in my hands and under my control. I need my castle. I need my life that was stolen from me by someone claiming to be who they are not.
