Dear China,

College, where I am from, often sends their students to study abroad. The school a student must choose is in another country that has a culture other than where they are from by default. The realization that I had one day about that kind of educational experience, if I chose to enjoy that luxury myself, was the awareness of some strata layered next to the the introspection layer that I would call some layer of ethnocentrism. That layer introspectively facsimiles thoughts of the cultures I would chose. The uncomfortable reality of that choice is how it will reveal an assortment of the preference, you and myself might have, of cultures other than our native ones. Sociology, most likely, goes over this somewhere, but if you are hungry, it is simply food for thought that is high in calories and zero grams of implication. Admittedly, I would have chosen Spain or some other European country. Informatively, I chose to study Spanish to satisfy my foreign language requirement. Practically, that choice was because Mexico is to my south. Realistically, this melting pot in the United States does not have much of an Asian layer of potting clay. I have a dream that all men are created equal too, but with very little Asian potting clay available in the art studio the summer of 1776. This is a disadvantage for me because the colors I shine have been misused like the colors that shine off a state flag. I wonder if those that misuse color also open a can of paint with a screwdriver.

Anything you gather from that story-prompt I hope might be similar to my intention to think about translation while you listen. If I could ask any other culture the kinds of questions with the same feeling you might get when you ask a grandparent, I would eventually lose confidence in an interpretive system approaching infinity questions from me through to you. After the temptation to ask you about God arrived as one of those infinite amount of questions, the lesson I have found is that a day has arrived when I no longer feel the need to. Maybe a better question is if you see my thoughts as a climb up a mountain or a roll down the other side, then would both visualizations help you vicariously anticipate my next moment of wonder following the temptations to ask you about my God or empathetically anticipate my next moment of wonder following the temptations to ask you about my God? The dynamics of the interaction of those two entities I just painted, in our minds, occasionally resemble what it is like for me to perpetually consider all of history while God is my imaginary friend that I have pretended to see in a few of you. If that imagery invites you to imagine a fist-bump with Jesus and I, then sure because that actually happened and because the _actual_ fist bump was last Passover one night when I was led downstairs to open the back door and momentarily rest standing at its threshold gripping two intense levels of reciprocating fear and relief. A provocative way I interpret that experience was similar to the images you might see when someone is initiated into a street gang. Instead of punches thrown with a rhythm of these subsequent hands to pull you back to your feet, they were emotions approaching as close to infinity for both joy and despair without being absolute joy and despair slated as 50 / 50 without any concept of a subtotal. The tempo felt like the speed-bag a fighter uses for training. Would you consider that punching-bag a form of personification or a form of comparison between my rate of emotions and something else? If I played you my thoughts on slow-motion video, would the ones on Passover seem more pleasant if you saw the punching-bag as a baseball thrown back and forth with some of the returns arriving at angles you could only hope to predict. Preparedness for me in that situation is to square-up so the ball has my body could provide an added level of protection from the ball getting behind me because my ultimate desire is to return a return in those throws of recursion.
