Dear China,

College, where I am from, often sends their students to study abroad. The school a student must choose is in another country that has a culture other than where they are from by default. The realization that I had one day about that kind of educational experience, if I chose to enjoy that luxury myself, was the awareness of some some strata next to the the introspection layer that I would call some layer of ethnocentrism. That layer introspectively facsimiles thoughts of the cultures I would chose. The uncomfortable reality of that choice is how it will reveal an assortment of the preference, you and myself might have, of cultures other than our native ones. Sociology, most likely, goes over this somewhere, but if you are hungry, it is simply food for thought that is high in calories and zero grams of implication. Admittedly, I would have chosen Spain or some other European country. Informatively, I chose to study Spanish to satisfy my foreign language requirement. Practically, that choice was because Mexico is to my south. Realistically, this melting pot in the United States does not have much of an Asian layer of potting clay. I have a dream that all men are created equal too, but with very little Asian potting clay available in the art studio the summer of 1776. This is a disadvantage for me because the colors I shine have been misused like the colors that shine off a state flag. I wonder if those that misuse color also open a can of paint with a screwdriver.
