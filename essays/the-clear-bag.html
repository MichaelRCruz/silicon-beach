# The Clear Bag

On my wrists were two watches that I wore the day I circled Santa Monica airport on foot until that march brought me there. It could have been exhaustion or confusion, but I managed to find one power outlet that worked that overlooked the runway. A few gentleman were talking as if they were there to see the planes regularly. I had some water with me, but I tried to find comfort in this dream that someone was going to land to scoop me out of a place that suddenly changed. I was not able to figure out how to find an airplane there, but I did have my two watches.

Before I came close to any understanding as to why I was there, I first had to understand why these construction machines were doing with their engines whenever I looked at them or paid any attention. The sounds of them began to worry me about how well I could hear or how well I used to hear. The only thing I could make from that was to thibnk of them as barriers of sound. In other words it felt like they funneled me to a vantage point where I did that thing with the watches.

When I made it, it was calm. The only thing I could hear was the notification heard through the soft speaker above me for about ten planes as they arrived or departed that afternoon. My watches kept me occupied as I braided two together as one Apple watch band that you could not wear as one watch, but maybe. Maybe I was able to figure out the other way too with the eyes looking into the other, probably.

My other Los Angeles airport experience was LAX when I walked from Marina Del Rey with a skateboard. Please do not try that at home because you might die. When I got to the top of that hill, the nightmare contuniued to unfold when the signs I took down off the pillars the moment I arrived to _departures_. The police did not like that, but if this next part does not disgust you, then God stay with me becuase what happened here?

There was a ride to a hospital for me after I tried not saying anything to the police this time. Three or four took me inside and I sat for a few minutes waiting for something they never tell you. In fact every encounter with the police is most stressful when they do not tell you where you are going, how this will go, and all the rest. We were on our way though and we got there just in time for another one they brough in shortly after me. So there was two of us waiting with four police officers. A nurse or nursing assistant walked out with a clipboard and while she was talking to the police she dropped her clipboard. or her pen. She dropped something. She looked nervous.

When it was my turn to enter this room the police could have told me that they were about to bring me to another room with a table. It was a stainless steel table with straps that they used. This was the moment I thought some torutre was about to take place so I went let all muscle tension go to try and escape it in my mind somehow. Before I actually went unconscious another nurse had a device she was trying to insert into my nose. They did not say what was about to happen. She just said to not move otherwise it would break off into my brain. When she got as far as she needed, her device clipped the inside of my nose and it smelled like narcotics. From there I assumed I was about to sleep inside another sleep.

The moment I woke up there was a plate of food ans much as I could ask for and then I ate and then I slept again. The moment I woke up again, I asked and another nurse let me know what I had to do. Just like from ther movie, 1984, I was in a wheelchair rolled into a room with _another_ nurse, but the boss one, but she was on a video screen. She asked me if I used drugs. I said no. Moments later I was given back all my stuff including my skateboard. Before I left, and as bad as I wanted to smoke outsdide, I found a pen I thought was taken from me the night I slept at that place in Chicago. It was the plastic pen with the four different colors.

Outside a woman asked me for a lighter or a smoke or she just asked me something, but maybe it was change. I gave her something and right away she handed me a clear bag and it had this huge knife in it, this manicure set, and a pair of broken glasses that were my perscription of +5, and some other stuff. There were also some old pictures in it. What this person told me I cannot rememebr exactly because I was looking through the stuff at the time, but the impression I got was that some one wanted me to have it. The knife scared me and it all just seemed so odd, or I should say, my intuition told me it may have been a set up. Regretably I touched the knife and that spooked me into only taking the glasses, the manicure set, and the McFlurry spoon.

Did these items once belong to the love if my life and she was she dead, I feared. Was I too late and someone killed her? Was she abducted? Was I being framed? Was she framed? As I looked through the stuff each item I carefully consider taking with me. I did not look at the pictures, but the glasses really got to me. I felt like this person was like me and thought like me and was resourcefull like me. It felt like she thought as crazy as I did or as aware of something that finally got her. Maybe the handoff of the bag was the best and closest thing to the truth they could offer.

Another woman showed rolled up and said something indistinguishable when the person with the clear bag encouraged me it was alright. Through the car window she gave me a bag full of food so I sat and ate with the person who had the clear bag. I wish I could tell you what we talked about. When I left was when I did the thing with my ankle and the beads.
