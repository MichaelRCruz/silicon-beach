# The Clear Bag

The pillars outside of departures had these pandemic signs reminding the world about the six-feet rule, but that set me off because of how the designer presented the message. It was a diagram of two people, like what you would see on the restroom doors in public. The signs I began pulling off the pillars had person diagrams, but it was one woman and one man with that two-way arrow splitting them up and signalling to all to stay away from each other.


You or the reader are probably thinking what is wrong with that. For myself, I do not know, but at that time I must nown, but it was enough to set me off and I began taking all the signs off the pillars. The police showed up, I kept my mouth shut, and they took me to the hospital in, I think, Torrance. Do not worry, I will get back to the music and somehting else eventually in this essay, but please let me finish this story about the hospital I was taken to.

In Chicago, you know about the pen that was taken from me when I was sleeping in that Airbnb. It was the same night my ri swapped out for, what I think is, the original. When they released me from the hospital I went through my luggage. That pen was in there, but this was before Chicago. Therefore, that was the pen swiped from me in the night, but the peculiar thing, this time, is that I left that pen in Milwaukee. How did end up in my luggage in Torracce? Was it They? In make-believe Michaelville, that was a pleasant thought. I settled for that explanation, left the hospital, had a cigarette, and gave one to a woman on the side of the street that asked for one.

She gave me this stuff, though. It was a clear bag. It had this huge knife in it, this manicure set, and a pair of broken g that were my perscription of +5, and some other stuff. There were also some old pictures in it. What this person told me I cannot rememebr exactly because I was looking through the stuff at the time, but the impression I got was that some one wanted me to have it all. The knife scared me and it all just seemed so odd, or I should say, my intuition told me it may have been a set up. Regretably I touched the knife and that spooked me into only taking the glasses, the manicure set, and the McFlurry spoon.

Did these items once belong to the love if my life? Was she dead? Was I too late and someone killed her? Was she abducted? being framed? The knife was a nice touch, but those glasses really scared me. There was one strand of long hair stuck to them whihc meant, to me, that they were recently broken and not handled much before they were given to me.

Now that you and the reader have a better understanding of what I was facing out there in make-believe, you might appreciat next part and this next part should also be a nice bridge back to Dillon and the land of milk and honey.
