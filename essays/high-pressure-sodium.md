One day I suggested to a friend that I may have a near perfect memory. He asked why. After describing to him about how deep my feelings are in any conversation, the recollection of those emotions are what allowed me to remember them so well. The suggestion, then, was that my memory might be _audiographic_ as opposed to _photographic_. Take that as you will.

This is a very serious story, and of course, there is anxiety that comes from my desire to tell you _all_ of it by memory. As I loop through the places I have been in the last two years, I see how easily it would be to lose track because I was in Chicago for three visits, Los Angeles for at least two, Indianapolis for a few days, Cincinnati a couple of nights, Salt Lake City for about five or seven days, and then back to the city I grew up as a child. There is much to tell you. Rather than begin this story in Madison, where the strange realities of this world began to show themselves to me, its best to start with the most unexplainable of them all.

I just got off the California Zephyr that ran from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City, where I boarded, and then into Chicago. It was two days on that train. They were peaceful days considering I was mostly escaping my homelessness in Los Angeles hoping to have a friend where I was headed. I had a little money, but only the amounts I was able to hang on to that did not disappear. I mean, I had enough to lend Russ $300 that he asked for, but he gave me his leather jacket so we are even.

The Zephyr was new to me. In fact, the name was familiar when I first noticed it on a mural back in Los Angeles on Washington Boulevard. The artwork is rather large so I sat against the wall and drank my soda until I was kicked out from the place I bought it from. It was very strange how quickly she got to me. How did she know I was on the side of the building drinking the soda I bought from her? To be fair, she did mention that she knew I was a patron a few minutes ago, but she had to kick me out. That was the kind of thing that really increased in frequency these last few years. If they can find something they will get me on it.

Besides all that, there was the art. The mural got my attention in this hypnotizing way that I cannot explain. Have you ever been to church and felt like the words of the preacher were written for you that Sunday? That is how it feels when I see art these days. Countless times I have been brought to tears by the way they all seemed to find something about me that has never been known before. The message I got from the artwork was the Zephyr. It was written there on the wall for me, but I just did not know until the future.

For now, I have to skip the part about the earthquake, the mixed up flights at the Bob Hope airport, the _airpod_ I dropped at the coffee shop, my arrest in Salt Lake City, and the hero that got me on the train to Chicago. Eventually, I will tell all these stories, but my focus for now is the haunted house on Maplewood.

The driver dropped me off, I grabbed some weed at a dispensary, bought a copy of the Chicago Tribune, and made my way to Milwaukee Avenue for a place to go. I had enough money to buy myself dinner, but instead, I sat on the sidewalk and rolled a joint. The front page of the paper, that day, told a story about this thing called _Operation Legend_. Apparently, the federal government made some changes that had people worried. What worried me was the story that journalist told about a guy in a traffic stop that was charged with some gun crime, but the feeling I got was that it was a set-up.

Russ was not there to meet me that night, nor was he for more than a week. I was pretty upset with him because of that, but we still talk. I mean, as of now, he is the only friend I have and that is a little concerning if you consider how happy I was with all the friends and family I had my entire life. Russ and I almost got an apartment together, but he weirded me out enough one day that I decided against it. That was a difficult choice because of how much distance I wanted between myself and my family. This is how the adventure started in Chicago the second time. All of it was like the the chase in Los Angeles that you will eventually read about in these essays. Unless, of course, you prefer to believe what you have already heard.

At $35 per night, the Airbnb I found was almost too affordable. but there I was at that place on Maplewood just down the street from that facade.
