One day I suggested to a friend that I may have a near perfect memory. He asked why. After describing to him about how deep my feelings are in any conversation, the recollection of those emotions are what allowed me to remember them so well. The suggestion, then, was that my memory might be _audiographic_ as opposed to _photographic_. Take that as you will.

This is a very serious story, and of course, there is anxiety that comes from my desire to tell you _all_ of it by memory. As I loop through the places I have been in the last two years, I see how easily it would be to lose track because I was in Chicago for three visits, Los Angeles for at least two, Indianapolis for a few days, Cincinnati a couple of nights, Salt Lake City for about five or seven days, and then back to the city I grew up as a child. There is much to tell you. Rather than begin this story in Madison, where the strange realities of this world began to show themselves to me, its best to start with the most unexplainable of them all.

I just got off the California Zephyr that ran from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City, where I boarded, and then into Chicago. It was two days on that train. They were peaceful days considering I was mostly escaping my homelessness in Los Angeles hoping to have a friend where I was headed. I had a little money, but only the amounts I was able to hang on to that did not disappear. I mean, I had enough to lend Russ $300 that he asked for, but he gave me his leather jacket so we are even.

The Zephyr was new to me. In fact, the name was familiar when I first noticed it on a mural back in Los Angeles on Washington Boulevard. The artwork is rather large so I sat against the wall and drank my soda until I was kicked out from the place I bought it from. It was very strange how quickly she got to me. How did she know I was on the side of the building drinking the soda I bought from her? To be fair, she did mention that she knew I was a patron a few minutes ago, but she had to kick me out. That was the kind of thing that really increased in frequency these last few years. If they can find something they will get me on it.

Besides all that, there was the art. The mural got my attention in this hypnotizing way that I cannot explain. Have you ever been to church and felt like the words of the preacher were written for you that Sunday? That is how it feels when I see art these days. Countless times I have been brought to tears by the way the artists found something about me that has never been known before. The message I got from that mural was the Zephyr. It was written on the wall for me, but I just did not know it was a message until the future.

Later, I have to tell you about the earthquake, the mixed up flights at the Bob Hope airport, the communications device I lost at the coffee shop, my arrest in Salt Lake City, and the hero that put me on the train to Chicago. Eventually, I will tell all these stories, but my focus for now is the haunted house on Maplewood.

The thirty-five-dollar rate brought me there for the first night and kept me there several nights after. They sent the door code prior to arrival so I entered through the front door of the bed and breakfast, noticed the sign to take off my shoes, set my luggage down, and selected a bed. What caught me by surprise was that the first floor of the two-story home had a kitchen and a bathroom, but the living room had three twin-size beds each separated by a temporary, but decorative, wall. The bed was plenty comfortable and had a cute lamp next to it that looked like someone made it themselves. There was also a little USB-A outlet for your phone or watch.

I sat down, looked around the place, and noticed there was a bedroom on this first floor as well. In there was a queen-size bed, that was made, and with the door open. The bedroom must not have been an option for me, but that was the least of my concern. How was a home like this, in this neighborhood, running there living room like a rooming house with three identical twin beds. I mean, that will explain the affordable rate I was paying, but when I get into the details here, you will understand just how odd this all was to me.

There was a coat rack just in case someone wanted to hang their jacket, a bucket for your umbrella, a laundry basket with no indication that there was a washing machine nearby, and plastic in the windows despite the middle of summer in Chicago. There was also plenty of blankets. The bed was comfortable and I slept just fine the first night, but then even more confusion set in when I saw the backyard in the daylight the next day.

That same night the owner walked downstairs to greet me. I thanked him for the place to stay and mentioned that I would be smoking herb outside in the backyard most of the time. He was fine with this, but wanted to make sure I knew to keep it quiet with the back door since it squeaked so much.

The door was so poorly hung that I had to think this was on purpose. I mean, to tell me that and for me to notice the beautiful wood table in the kitchen was a conflict I my brain was not liking in the least. The owner went upstairs. I smoked my herb and then went to bed.

The driver dropped me off, I grabbed some weed at a dispensary, bought a copy of the Chicago Tribune, and made my way to Milwaukee Avenue for a place to go. I had enough money to buy myself dinner, but instead, I sat on the sidewalk and rolled a joint. The front page of the paper, that day, told a story about this thing called _Operation Legend_. Apparently, the federal government made some changes that had people worried. What worried me was the story that journalist told about a guy in a traffic stop that was charged with some gun crime, but the feeling I got was that it was a set-up.

Russ was not there to meet me that night, nor was he for more than a week. I was pretty upset with him because of that, but we still talk. I mean, as of now, he is the only friend I have and that is a little concerning if you consider how happy I was with all the friends and family I had my entire life. Russ and I almost got an apartment together, but he weirded me out enough one day that I decided against it. That was a difficult choice because of how much distance I wanted between myself and my family. This is how the adventure started in Chicago the second time. All of it was like the the chase in Los Angeles that you will eventually read about in these essays. Unless, of course, you prefer to believe what you have already heard.

At $35 per night, the Airbnb I found was almost too affordable. but there I was at that place on Maplewood just down the street from that facade.
