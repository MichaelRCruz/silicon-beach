One day I suggested to a friend that I may have a near perfect memory. He asked why, but after describing how deeply my feelings can get in any conversation, it was the recollection of those emotions that allowed me to remember them so well. The suggestion, then, was that my memory might be audiographic as opposed to photographic, but I think it is both to some extent. Just know I have a really good memory. Proper nouns, though. Those are the imperfections of my recollections.
