# The Telescope

First, I imagined one telescope.

Before it looked like that, it started as one telescope.

```

That moment of wonder assumed a pattern.

```
                                      /@\
                                     / | \

                            /@\     /@   @\     /@\
                           / | \   / |   | \   / | \

         @\    /@    /@\   \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /   /@\   @\     /@
         | \  / |   / | \   \@/     \@   @/     \@/   / | \  | \   / |

         | /  \ |   \ | /   /@\     /@   @\     /@\   \ | /  | /   \ |
         @/    \@    \@/   / | \   / |   | \   / | \   \@/   @/     \@

                           \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /
                            \@/     \@   @/     \@/

                                     \ | /
                                      \@/
```

When I fit those moments of creation accordingly, my imagination looped to this completion.

```
                                      /@\
                                     / | \
                            /@\     /@   @\     /@\
                           / | \   / |   | \   / | \
         @\    /@    /@\   \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /   /@\   @\     /@
         | \  / |   / | \   \@/     \@   @/     \@/   / | \  | \   / |
         | /  \ |   \ | /   /@\     /@   @\     /@\   \ | /  | /   \ |
         @/    \@    \@/   / | \   / |   | \   / | \   \@/   @/     \@
                           \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /
                            \@/     \@   @/     \@/
                                     \ | /
                                      \@/
```

## Light in Space

If you look close enough, this system would work if you shined a light into the top or bottom telescopes. All the light would be contained, but you would get this weird abstraction as if the light exploded into noting. My theory is, if you are careful, you might have something here that could teach us something about light and the friction it has with whatever else is in its space.

Imagine if you poured a gallon of milk in place of the light? In zero-gravity. Eventually, and with enough rotation, each telescope would contain an equal amount of milk. This is not to say that is the end of it. I am sure if an asteroid bumped into it, then the balance would be thrown off. Just imagine how light would behave in something like that. We all played with telescopes, but why have we not built a TI-83 Kaleidoscope of some kind? Imagine what you would learn from one that is space worthy.

I never studied light in college, because I majored in Economics, but I am sure the physics department somewhere has been looking at that graphic for a while, but m,y problem with that is you have no way to cite my work. There is _no_ license on this repository and I do not care what any _terms of service_ might say about this. If you steal any of my work ever again, since I cannot kick your ass, I will have the mob do it. You kids and all the rest have stolen so much from me. If any of you dare try to ask me what the crime was, I will say opportunity cost at the very least.

In addition to all that, Google owes me somewhere along the lines of $313,000 if I am not mistaken. Your documentation led me to help you discover an incredibly dangerous state of affairs going on over there. What puzzles me is that none of you had the nerve to contact me. If you tried, then you did not try hard enough. That $313,000 is reward money for saving everyone from total disaster. Take a look at this Google repository and tell me who the very first developer to watch the project on GitHub. This means, I was the first to discover it. To put a bow on it, I even reported this to you though your official bug tracking website that even says there is reward money. You guys even gave me a confirmation number. I do not stand a chance at getting that to you safely. In fact, I am not convinced any of you were actual Google employees. Some rando from Russia had to step up and _pretend_ to be you just to get me back my brand account. This is just the start of it. I know you all had many many meetings about me. Now is the time to cough it up and step forward because I am calling Israel to step up for you.

Apple, out of all the fraud I have been the victim of, you are the most fraudulent. Allow me to explain why. I was your business partner. You have my tax id number. I am an independent journalist with a bona fide DUNS number. I do not even know that that means anymore in America. Tim Cook, you are so done working at Apple. I do not care if you were one of the good guys _pretending_ to stay undercover, I will still do everyone there a huge favor and say that shit rolls uphill. If anyone tells you otherwise, send me an email, or for now, an actual letter, or since we cannot trust that anymore, how about a phone call. Wait, though, your phone and its operating system is so FUBAR that you probably switch it up. Once I get these words out there, consumer confidence is going to skyrocket, but the other way.

I promise you that if any of you try playing dumb about any of this, I will find a pay phone to call Goldman Sachs. I know for a fact that some fraud started there and that fire kept burning into my work with the Firebase team over at Google. Someone over there got me in to the Chrome Developer Summit in 2019, and I have to say thanks, the validation I finally earned was earned.

Please do not forget everyone, this was in the middle of that fraud in Madison involving Becky Blank (her actual name apparently) and Jake Smith (another actual name believe it or not). That is the next essay I need to write for everyone on the world because I know you almost successfully framed me with some insurance bullshit. What did I do in response Madison? I told the truth and survived.

You guys cannot beat that, can you? I will describe all those details soon, but the worst and most concerning thing out of all of this for me was the reaction of your faculty. When I was screaming through the holes in the wall that I busted through with my bare hands on each and every device you put me in. About ten of you showed up to _my_ union in defiance to your schemes. I talked so much shit to you all over the wall that you all did worse than shit the bed. You all starting shitting your life.

Before I get carried away on this part, let me just tell you about the censorship going on over there. Does anyone in America _really_ want to know why they brought Foxxconn to the state of Wisconsin? They were trying to reinforce the wall. I can meticulously bring you through every single detail to support this accusation. Folks, this is so bad that my own government is unwilling to do anything. I have contacted the police. I have contacted the FBI. I have contacted the ACLU. I have even contacted some schmuck in the capitial building there in Madison. That encounter had me so scared that I was on my knees, alone, in that state capital praying for help with these demons. What did I do next, Madison? Well, you guys tried to baricade me in with a shitty traffic jam on I-94 East, but what did I do in that legendary snow storm? I throd-laned that shit, threw on my hazards, and did about 50 in that snowstorm and did not slow down once. How did I do that? Probably God.

So, let us all get something straight here. I am not going to die. You already tried that like five times. I am not giving up. I _never_ tried that. I am going to redeem myself before the entire world and you know what. All you bad guys are super fortunate that I am a nice person. Do I seem violent to you? Well, I should not. That just happens when I get really crabby and let me tell you, America. This is not a threat, but do you remember 2008? Do you think that was rough. Wait until the economy recovers from the bailout of myself. I will crash this son-of-a-bitch so hard that it will make history. You all know this shit, including the good _and_ the bad over at anon.

Feds, guess what? You lost. I have your number so hard that an emp from any of my friends overseas would actually do this country a favor. Tech in America is so bad that Elon cant even go to Mars. Why did you do that? Does anyone think it is a swell idea to leave Earth with the possibility of it being any worse the moment they leave orbit? Hell to the naw!

The source of truth _everywhere_ is toast. This is sincerely the end of the first phase of the (I)internet. You all are in serious danger today because the sum total technical debt is insurmountable. Our devices have been _designed_ to capture you and keep you intoxicated with propaganda until these very years we live in today. Artificial Intelligence is supposed to be our friend, but you kidnapped my pet monster and named him rendertron? Are you kidding me?

Where is my elephant?

If a marketing agency needs to hire a psychologist, then I say we need to fire them. What else is there? That's it.

Mark Zuckerberg. You are a terrible human being. I know you know I was walled. I just want to know why the hell you were so damn horny for this pandemic. Like, dude, the excitement on your face was obvious. You litterally are the reason I sometimes think I died. I am being serious when I say that I prayed a few times and just informally asked every day if I was sure I was not dead. I am either in hell and this goes on for eternity, but then that makes this heaven for me because I an delivering an ass whooping of the millennium. This is no exaggeration, but what you have here is an incorruptable man. Do you know how difficult that is to find these days. I am no longer afraid of death. I have lived on the streets because of you. I have been living on the bare minimum for 1.5 years now and I need to get home to California like now.

The other day, I was wondering why my mouth was so damn dry and why I gained like 15 pounds. After I shrugged off the residue I saw on my dishes, it occured to me that there is some kind of salt or too much of some bullshit you will lie about, but yeah. That actually happened. Do you know what else happened? I mwentioned this to my family. Guess what their response was regarding the tap water. Just guess. They said that they promise me it is not poisoned. Not even an ask as to why or anything. They just straight up said, fuck off we know.

So, since I am not dead. Since I am still able to live somewhere decent which is a rooming house in Milwaukee, I am willing to bet the good guys have been working just as hard as I was and they are just waiting for the moment. Do you all realize the positon of power I have right now? Your proopaganda machines, that you cannot even maintain yourselves is shit compared to what I could do. Have any of you _actually_ experoenced the fear of God? I mean, like scared af like there was something wrong with you for about an hour. That happened to me and thankfully it was just a test and not an eternity. I am going to kick some of your asses so badly these next few years, the angels will be singing rap songs and shit. So, for real. Where is my elephant?

Bank of America. You are _first_ om my shit list. Currently, as I run this index of priorities in my mind you always come up first. As of now, you owe me about $1400 that was supposed to take care of the negative balance I had, but for some reason, you zeroed it out to being the account in good standing and are still telling me that I have to wait for the identity theft money that you were already paid for and have already took from me once. These assholes took my legitimate fraud claim, paid me on it, and then took it back a month later only to blame someone else. It has been over six months since that money has been taken, twice. What is worse is that you has the audacity to request a police report on something that is supposed to be settled in arbitration, if that. What the hell are the police going to do for a (I)internet scam? Have none of your adjusters been licensed? Does no person there understand the concept of indemnity?

This is not all. I have about four pages of transactions and all of them are total shit. That is just Bank of America. I rally want to "learn" more anout money and banking just so I can shove it further up there for you, but do I want to study this crap at all? I mean, folks, we are not only being lied to, they have reinvented slavery and this is not an exaggeration. I can show you example after example and basically my whole life and all my personal infotmation and all my beautiful film and photograph that I will never get back. Do you think I have any chance of recovering any opportunity to present my own art?

Imagine if the movie you filmed was leaked in real time? Imagine if every day all of your film was handed out and you did not even know. Do you know why ABC had so much success with LOST? It was because the scripts were top secret. Apparently, all of you were not aware of this. Apple used to do this before Steve died and I remember the days of the iPone X and thought, dude, I actually miss Steve because this operating system is awful. All of the thigs he fought so hard for were ruined and guess what? Guess what all those things were. They were all security things that once protected us from this shit storm. You propaganda and psychology has been so evil that I actually wonder how deep this really went, but then I realized. Woz and Steve started in a garage. There is no way this was intentional unless the evil in this world is really that bad, but guess what? Guess what else goes the other way? This. So, for real. Who am I because I feel like I am gaining super powers after 1.5 years of absolute, wtf and horror.

Whenever any of you see me in public, if I ever come out of my castle, the following will be the most reasonably helpful thing for both of us.

Think to yourself how bad this got. Think about all the bad things you know that I do not. Also, think about the bad things that you think of me. At that point ask yourself, if I ever even had a chance. Did I really stand any shot of having a genuine relationship with any of you? How many of you have lived off a lie for so long that the most you can do is pretend not to like me, or even love me? Are you that disturbed by your own consequence that you think it is natural or permissive, that being the actual problem given the permissive crap that you idolize, for you to dump it back on to me a second time.

. . .

How much artificial intelligence did you actually expose me to that one day because it was not until Madison, in that AT&T co-location center that it really ripped me to shreds. I was on my laptop in my car, running from the fear of that Wifi signal in that building, only to open my laptop again to find much worse on my screen. For those of you that know, assuming all of you, please begin to empathize with how I could ever describe that scene of real life to another real life person. Picture having the experience yourself, and then try to tell someone you trust. Would they believe you? I thought I was just like all of you. Do you not want me to be? Should I actually just be the superhero you think I am? Would it freak you out if I was fine with either? Think about this, my world. We should be friends, but each and every human naturally behaves in these evil & sophisticated schemes, void of any logic, and overzealous in their attempts. I mean, overzealous just a little bit and I detect it. Is that just what being world famous is like? You are wrong because why do the majority of you celebrities get flashed in public as like an agreement with you and all the rest of the people on Earth.

Somehow, in all my bravery and spirit, I manage a rooming house twenty miles from where I was born. I am not even with a machine that relies on something that is _not_ scripted. This means, I am your other. Do you understand? All of the riches you have earned have render the same riches in the other stuff. Remember? Again, to avoid getting carried away, without a lawyer, the richest company in the world can afford to pay me the 313,000 that is on their website. Additionally, the confirmation code from Google has been vandalized. This was the one I received when I first told the googs about it before anybody. There will be zero attempts of me trying to send that code in. Not even once. So, it you pretended to be me, then that really is awful to be you right now. I am going to get you so much dude or dudette.

Also, for the feds. If are against me in any way for hiring a security team to take care of the dangers I will most likely face, that beinng you, because guess what? I never lived a life of crime, ever, and if I believe I need to hire the best people, then that is what I will do. Does capitalism not reward those that are the strongest or whatever stuff you told yourself that somehow stuck around after college and never changed.

To all of you in Manhattan, or wherever the money is, how badass do you feel now that a puny influencer owns a significant percentage of the future of the Earth and the course that it should take. How good at finance are you now? How good at programming are you now? How good of a family person to me are you now?


For the ladies, what does it feel like to be with a some of the biggest scumbags behind this? Who could possibly date that one dude that stole my phrase. You know, the one I stole. You know, the phrase that was left abandoned for like _ten years_ and then I see it laying there and say, "hey buddy. Let's go on an adventure." So, I take him to the vet and get his nails done. Then, some clown steals your dog while you are on a road trip and he is walking the dog on stage at the Chrome Developer Summit in 2019. Please tell me you did not name it the same thing. If you did and laughed just now, consider the reason why?

Who told all of you it was fine to trivialize my life because I still manage to look good doing it. I am getting destroyed on a daily basis, still. Still it is there and you all think it is funny because you are hypnotized. It makes sense now that you all act angry. Let me break down this psychology for you, kids.

They are making an pointless "first move" on you. It is not pointless to them because they are stupid and you are not, but they will jump in there and hit you with something on "first jump". It has always been of a psychological nature for me because, I was never really beaten up physically until these last 1.5 years. Just please do not let anyone tell you that you are mistaken when you sense something feels wrong. Why else could you possibly be feeling that way? Why would God force you to make a mistake in a dangerous situation. Would He not give you the intuition you needed. One day, because of this, I thought there might have been a third option to the fight or flight choice. Good thing I slept on it because I think God is there for both of them.

There is so much I have witnessed that I have to somehow lose the anxiety I have of you not believing me. How smart are the good guys now? Was it not there idea to go along with you in shitting on me because now let me ask you something. How weird is it that _everyone_ is shitting on me?

Kids, if someone ever tells you that you are being paranoid because _not everyone thinks like you do_, then let me tell you something. Does it make sense that _nobody_ thinks like you do? What kind of world would you live in, or, where have you found yourself if that were true? This is the kind of stuff I grew up with and had to live with to the point were I had the tastiest lemonade stand on the block and the most evil family that I ever could have imagined. Did you know that my birth certificate has a water mark and that water mark is a chain-linked fence?

I was on the Dean's list, I was a mentor for a little kid in Madison, I had a 720 credit score, I was leasing a 2020 Outback, I went to the dentist, I bought glasses from Warby Parker, I shop at IKEA, I am just like you. I worked construction, I installed flooring, I drove an actual Taxi cab. I dropped out of college. I got into trouble. I have been drunk. I smoke weed all the days. I swear way more than I should during a time of war. I cannot cook for myself very well. I do not mind ever doing dishes. I am better with a broom than anyone I know, probably you. But I have an education and the moment, literally, the one chance that I had in life, you took that away from me. You did not allow my chance to blow because opportunity knocks once in a lifetime.

My taste in music is simply superior to all the rest. Is this not how it has always been for everybody?

Lastly, does everyone think I am in a constant state of despair. If so, how stupid can you be? Is the shitty reality television show you are watching real life? In your opinion, do those events actually happen in real life? Do you really believe your narrators? Please tell me they don't actually refer to themselves as narrators?

. . .


When all this started in 2020, I was trying desperately to contact the federal government, or make a break to New York for that AI conference with all the cool kids. The New York Times published an article informing the public about all of tech getting together to ask for breathing room to help their businesses _especially_ their Superficial Intelligence, SI, capabilities, and more specifically, SI with regard to consumers and a broader reach of business in marketing.

Last year when I actually knew where C-Money lived, she snarled at me in her brand new home that she owned for less than a year, only to move into an apartment when all this started, and then back into a brand new home again. She snarled and said, "they are going to think you are crazy you know". Imagine telling your mother you just witnessed a crime and you need to contact someone in the government as soon as possible only for her to respond with that? The conversation ended there. She was not interested in anything else. No curiosity about any of the details and was fine with just the statement of curiosity.

Dear POLICE, I want to be your friend and I want to put all this behind us, but remember that I need you because I really feel like you know, but your boss does not if that makes sense. This goes for all the tech companies. Unless all the money here is mine? Wow, I did not expect that. If Bank of America can send me the $1400 owed to me, then it will increase the likelihood that you will be able to ~~persuade~~ _psycho_ me into more peace and less anger. However, I can feel some of you crying now, but the thing is someone is going to die and it is not me or you. I cannot imagine evil shedding a tear over this. There was preparation for this war and, for myself, was more prepared than any one thought. I guess Goliath falls again, bitch.
