# The Telescope

First, I imagined one telescope.

Before it looked like that, it started as one telescope.

```

That moment of wonder assumed a pattern.

```
                                      /@\
                                     / | \

                            /@\     /@   @\     /@\
                           / | \   / |   | \   / | \

         @\    /@    /@\   \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /   /@\   @\     /@
         | \  / |   / | \   \@/     \@   @/     \@/   / | \  | \   / |

         | /  \ |   \ | /   /@\     /@   @\     /@\   \ | /  | /   \ |
         @/    \@    \@/   / | \   / |   | \   / | \   \@/   @/     \@

                           \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /
                            \@/     \@   @/     \@/

                                     \ | /
                                      \@/
```

When I fit those moments of creation accordingly, my imagination looped to this completion.

```
                                      /@\
                                     / | \
                            /@\     /@   @\     /@\
                           / | \   / |   | \   / | \
         @\    /@    /@\   \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /   /@\   @\     /@
         | \  / |   / | \   \@/     \@   @/     \@/   / | \  | \   / |
         | /  \ |   \ | /   /@\     /@   @\     /@\   \ | /  | /   \ |
         @/    \@    \@/   / | \   / |   | \   / | \   \@/   @/     \@
                           \ | /   \ |   | /   \ | /
                            \@/     \@   @/     \@/
                                     \ | /
                                      \@/
```

## Light in Space

If you look close enough, this system would work if you shined a light into the top or bottom telescopes. All the light would be contained, but you would get this weird abstraction as if the light exploded into noting. My theory is, if you are careful, you might have something here that could teach us something about light and the friction it has with whatever else is in its space.

This is what your telescope does. You know, the one you have from that rolled up map at the back of the atlas. If you cannot find it, then look for the map with the perforated edge.
