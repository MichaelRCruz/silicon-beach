# The Boyfriend Giant

I do not remember your name, but if I could call you, then this is what I would say.

I would tell you that I do not know the sound of your voice, nor what you look like, nor what your hair smells like, nor the colors of your eyes. The only thing I have of you is the feeling that you are here as if two souls share the same body. When I prayed for you, and a life of clarity, God answered with a terrifying love that had me in awe of the divine magnificence.

The way that I see the Earth is through even numbers and this world is without reason. I search for signs of life, but there is not any one here. Nothing is like it was. This place has a bend to it like when you are fishing and the tip of your pole breaks the surface of the water. Your mind will reach for it, but it has shifted a little in a direction relative to the sun.

The shape of this dimension is like the shadow of fifty-two playing cards. The shadow you need makes a shape called a parallelogram. That is where you will find me. If you decide to take my spaceship, then know how to sail a boat on an ocean of light that floods the ceiling of a room shaped like a globe. I found the maps to everything. Tell somebody. You should know all my cheat codes and also the number I am thinking of.

## The Outfield

It's so beautiful. To divide a choice into only two abstractions is a gift from the heavens despite the guarantee of those two choices by the laws of nature. To elaborate, imagine a bunch of bananas of three bananas or more. The reader might see each banana as a possibility, but the illusion of choice is hidden by nothing. What if you choose no such thing and there is no banana selected at all? This is how the natural duality of the Earth is for us. Your space is divided evenly, but to have consideration for nothing, still requires division. Mathematically speaking, maybe the reason we cannot divide by zero is because we are required to divide. The range from `0` to `1` is said to be infinitely divisible. This claim is demonstrated by a ceaseless division of a number greater than one. That method will get you to infinity. To get beyond that, consider the following.

The number, `5`, is significant because it is half of the base unit, `10`. That is our number system, _base ten_. If the range of `0` to `10` represented the sum total of existence, then to have exactly half of that is quite remarkable, but to show why, begin by thinking of the number `5` as a subspace carved out from the multispace array defined as the array containing this universe plus at least one other universe that can do whatever. The number `5` represents the space occupied by our universe and the other _half_ of that space is that other universe. The base unit, `10`, is our multispace array, but also our total space.

`[six, eight, four, one, zero, one, three, five, seven, nine]`

If we have a sum total space of 10 and if no such thing cannot occupy the same space in the same moment, then consider a sum total space as a list of data types rather than numbers. If each item of that list is its own universe, then we should call each item an object. For example, consider the baseball universe as an object found in a list. Programming languages have lists, but in that universe they call them arrays.

        0: "theBatter",
        1: "thePitcher",
        3: shortstop,
        5: secondBase,
        7: leftField,
        9: rightField
    ]

## How to Time Travel

In make-believe michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him. He is so far away. He is close enough to observe the entire history of the universe inn one stream inside a human box office. He lives forever so time means nothing to him. Here is the part that scares everyone. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with his phone that uses light in addition to sound.

He just observes his nature shows all day. At night _the boyfriend giant_ uses the stars or the moon to navigate by any means necessary. If you were to ask me if it was worth it, I would say for our sake yes. Imagine a world with no history. Imagine a world with no future.

A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds like a wanning moon shinning its light that approaches zero or the waxing light that approaches one.
