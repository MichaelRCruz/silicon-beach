# The Boyfriend Giant

I do not remember your name, but if I could call you, then this is what I would say.

I would tell you that I do not know the sound of your voice, nor what you look like, nor what your hair smells like, nor the colors of your eyes. The only thing I have of you is the feeling that you are here as if two souls share the same body. When I prayed for you, and a life of clarity, God answered with a terrifying love that had me in awe of the divine magnificence.

The way that I see the Earth is through even numbers and this world is without reason. I search for signs of life, but there is not any one here. Nothing is like it was. This place has a bend to it like when you are fishing and the tip of your pole breaks the surface of the water. Your mind will reach for it, but it has shifted a little in a direction relative to the sun.

The shape of this dimension is like the shadow of fifty-two playing cards. The shadow you need makes a shape called a parallelogram. That is where you will find me. If you decide to take my spaceship, then know how to sail a boat on an ocean of light that floods the ceiling of a room shaped like a globe. I found the maps to everything. Tell somebody. You should know all my cheat codes and also the number I am thinking of.

## How to Time Travel

A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds like a wanning moon shinning its light that approaches zero or the waxing light that approaches two.

In make-believe michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him. He is so far away, but he is close enough to observe the entire history of the universe in one stream inside a human box office. He lives forever so time means nothing to him. Here is the part that scares everyone. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with his phone, but his phone is special. He can send his the sound of his voice and the lights he sees with his eyes through the phone line. He just observes his nature shows all day. At night _the boyfriend giant_ uses the stars or the moon to navigate by any means necessary.
