# The Boyfriend Giant

I do not remember your name, but if I could call you, then this is what I would say.

I would tell you that I do not know the sound of your voice, nor what you look like, nor what your hair smells like, nor the colors of your eyes. The only thing I have of you is the feeling that you are here as if two souls share the same body. When I prayed for you, and a life of clarity, God answered with a terrifying love that had me in awe of the divine magnificence.

The way that I see the Earth is through even numbers and this world is without reason. I search for signs of life, but there is not any one here. Nothing is like it was. This place has a bend to it like when you are fishing and the tip of your pole breaks the surface of the water. Your mind will reach for it, but it has shifted a little in a direction relative to the sun.

The shape of this dimension is like the shadow of fifty-two playing cards. The shadow you need makes a shape called a parallelogram. That is where you will find me. If you decide to take my spaceship, then know how to sail a boat on an ocean of light that floods the ceiling of a room shaped like a globe. I found the maps to everything. Tell somebody. You should know all my cheat codes and also the number I am thinking of.

## The Outfield

It's so beautiful. To divide a choice into only two abstractions is a gift from the heavens despite the guarantee of those two choices by the laws of nature. To elaborate, imagine a bunch of bananas of three bananas or more. The reader might see each banana as a possibility, but the illusion of choice is hidden by nothing. What if you choose no such thing and there is no banana selected at all? This is how the natural duality of the Earth is for us. Your space is divided evenly, but to have consideration for nothing, still requires division. Mathematically speaking, maybe the reason we cannot divide by zero is because we are required to divide. The range from `0` to `1` is said to be infinitely divisible. This claim is demonstrated by a ceaseless division of a number greater than one. That method will get you to infinity. To get beyond that, consider the following.

The number, `5`, is significant because it is half of the base unit, `10`. That is our number system, _base ten_. If the range of `0` to `10` represented the sum total of existence, then to have exactly half of that is quite remarkable, but to show why, begin by thinking of the number `5` as a subspace carved out from the multispace array defined as the array containing this universe plus at least one other universe that can do whatever. The number `5` represents the space occupied by our universe and the other _half_ of that space is that other universe. The base unit, `10`, is our _God array_, i.e., the total sum space of universal history.

`[six, eight, four, one, zero, one, three, five, seven, nine]`

If we have a sum total space of 10 and if no such thing cannot occupy the same space in the same moment, then consider a sum total space as a list of data types rather than numbers. If each item of that list is its own universe, then we should call each item an object. For example, consider the baseball universe as an object found in a list. Programming languages have lists, but in that universe they call them arrays.

###### Figure 2

// the baseball subset
[

. . .

    "baseball": {
        "8": "center field",
        "6": "third base",
        "4": "first base",
        "2": "the catcher",
        "0": "the batter",
        "1": "the pitcher",
        "3": "the shortstop",
        "5": "second base",
        "7": "left field",
        "9": "right field"
    },

. . .

```

An array in JavaScript is a list of entities of various data _types_. Most programming languages only allow one data type per list or per array. In our example, the _God array_ is a list of objects. Each object has a set of key-value pairs where the  key-value pairs are one-to-one, for now. If you cherry-picked the baseball subset of moments out of the _God array_, then `Figure 2` would be the universal baseball moments. This is to exemplify a category in life that is well-defined.

> Life should _not_ imply anything about baseball. Baseball should imply anything about life.

Sorted lists are an important concept to be familiar with here and with programming. An array can be sorted by calendar date, by numerical value, by alphabetical order, etc., but the _God Array_ is sorted by something else entirely we will discuss in another essay. Please be aware that the object of universal baseball moments is not sorted, by virtue of the fact that objects in programming are ordered.

One last concept to know is about reference. Programming languages require the boyfriend giant to reference his arrays and objects differently. This means the syntax of the code he uses will be different for an object compared to the reference of an array. This is the reason _sort_ and _order_ are different. Sequence matters in an array because of its index, but sequence does not matter for the keys of an object. In other words, you _cannot_ ask for the nth key-value pair of an object, but you _can_ ask for the nth value of an array. Likewise, you _cannot_ reference an element by its name, but you _can_ reference a key-value pair by its name.

If you are still with me, then we can now explain why boyfriend giant has defined the keys of the universal baseball moments as numbers. Since the same order is not guaranteed for the subsequent reference of an object, then that might explain the peculiar order that the keys of the universal baseball moment are in. Notice how your giant boyfriend has staggered the numerical keys starting with `0` as the center. Your giant boyfriend calls this the **Order of Tessellation**.

## The Orders of Tessellation & Magnitudes of Time

Are you familiar with _orders of magnitude_ in mathematics? If not, no worries. Figure 3 represents the same universal baseball moments as a different graphic. Here you will need to imagine two clocks.

## How to Time Travel

A romantic refraction is wonder beyond the clouds like a wanning moon shinning its light that approaches zero or the waxing light that approaches two.

In make-believe michaelville, your boyfriend is like a giant in outer-space. Pretend he is so big that the total light from the Milky Way is like a television show for him. He is so far away, but he is close enough to observe the entire history of the universe in one stream inside a human box office. He lives forever so time means nothing to him. Here is the part that scares everyone. Your giant boyfriend recorded it all with his phone, but his phone is special. He can send his the sound of his voice and the lights he sees with his eyes through the phone line. He just observes his nature shows all day. At night _the boyfriend giant_ uses the stars or the moon to navigate by any means necessary.
