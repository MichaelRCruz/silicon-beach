# The Boyfriend Giant

I do not remember your name, but if I could call you, then this is what I would say.

I would tell you that I do not know the sound of your voice, nor what you look like, nor what you smell like, or the colors of you. The only thing I have is the feeling that you are here. For a moment I wonder the reason, but I know myself and I would say that it is better than nothing and I would ask you to be here just in case.

The way that I see the world is through even numbers and for the first time, my world is without logic so does that mean I am dead? I search for it in my mind, but it is not here so maybe I do not think I should stay nor should you have to live this torture. Everything is upside down, but in this terrible way that it can lead to madness. It is this tweak or refraction. Maybe this is all I can say about this world. It has a bend to it like when you are fishing and the tip of your pole breaks the surface of the water. Your mind will reach for it, but it is shifted a little in a direction relative to the sun.

The shape this dimension makes is like the shadow of a deck of cards, but there are only two shadows that have two sets of angles. If all four corners are equal, then try another one of the six shadows. A 1/3 chance.

The shadow you need makes a unique shape called a parallelogram. Can you measure the area of all six shadows, record the sum of the two parallelograms, then record the sum of the remaining four areas? divide one with the other. If the product is less than 1, take that value and divide by 2.

That is where you will find me. If you decide to take my spaceship, then know how to sail a boat on an ocean that floods the ceiling of a room shaped like a sphere.

I found the map to everything. Tell somebody, but just-in-case, play DOOM and know all the cheat codes and also the number I am thinking of.
