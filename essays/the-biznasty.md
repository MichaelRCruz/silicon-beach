# The Biznasty

Gentlemen, I must say that if we lose everything or never will have anything, it will be work. We own that in a sense. Is it not our domain? I know there will be many people mad at me for saying some of this, but then your friend will tell you otherwise and you will be all like, ah.

If women have the collective responsibility, opportunity, or burden to bare children, then men must carry a collective responsibility, opportunity, or burden to work. If men cannot bare children and children can work, then women can work too. Of these three, in the realm of working, do you believe should have a choice to work or not work. Men are the only third that must. It is written. When was it ever a good idea to know the pay of someone else? What happens every time? It is not easy to resist temptation to know nor is it easy to avoid the convulsion of politics and business.

What would happen if the government took a glance at the economy, made a decision, and doubled the pay for every man, gave women and teenagers the choice to work? For those, not married, would benefit from half the salary of the cumulative total of all the men in that economy in addition to the choice to work. What if you had a system that played that game for every entitlement we could imagine? How can we possibly indemnify all groups with claim and statistic? A possible response to these sorts of politics is usually undesirable. What if gender was removed from all public concepts of identity. Why are the most common questions on all government form difficult to answer? What does that say about the data they use to make their decisions?

What is the difference between reparations and indemnification? Will a new opportunity with bonus ever be sufficient for either? What if the desire to try reveled the need to think more carefully about money. How many people truly understand what is going on here with all the money? What were we taught about interest? What have we learned from it? Why keep doing the thing? Do many of you love it that much? If we do not teach your children about money in public school, is it because we actually know nothing about it? What if another reason is that it would require an adult to teach them, but how would you feel if that adult was described as someone that knew money really well? Would you want your child around that person? Why does the thought of mixing children and people that know money a creepy thought? A better question is this. If we get weirded-out about that, then why do you make money an axis?

#### The Bachelors Associate Degree

This seems like horse shit in the sense that they were bullshitting on the equal opportunity everything. An undergraduate degree is still awesome. Is it even a thing anymore? Now that it is not and we know it can break, then what would happen if we did nothing first? Higher education would pick back up and also stuck to it would be all the shit from the horse and the bull. I guess this happens. The one before it landed in shit was not bad. You chose your own classes and they were nice enough to create a maze for you. That provided an anonymous structure for anyone to utilize. The problems were with money, but how much did the state did they belong to? What hidden path in that maze have they found or what hidden paths have they built into the maze?

For starters, what if your student debt was your kidnapping bounty that piled you into their system? There was still movement towards the end, but that is what they held on to. There was an internal frame around us that kept us bound within another realm, life. Would it make sense to say this was one of the first things they figured out? After all, many of us were required to work and the first thought of any natural adversary would be something boxing you around that requirement. It seems like that harsh reality influenced other evils in this world that taught them how in smaller circles. They have crept as close to the people I knew and then around myself. At the least this is the truth I feel within myself and at most some truth with all of you.

The only other thought was the coincidence that Wisconsin and California have with their naming convention. Is there any other states like this? If so, why?

#### The For Profit Degree

What if we had enough computing power to track all the money that was lost by the people that paid the tuition of for profit colleges? Imagine what that would look like. This would draw from the salaries of those working an honest job, but what if that lost space was inflation? What if we used inflation to account for stuff like that, and anything else we can find similar, that would model a reality of that reversed world? Some one could draw that.

#### The Public School

The most astonishing thing that comes to mid is when I grew up and realized that your time at anything is time your parents are working. After that people usually have dinner. People get tired and then go to sleep.

#### The Tuition

If I recall correctly, the state is allowed up to a five percent increase in tuition, but that number might have changed. I feel like they still do something like that. The embarrassing thing is that they have a choice of how much of that five percent to take. They always take five. This is because your tuition is guaranteed to them. It matters who you are and also it does not. For example, they have admissions because they need that demand. The demand is set by themselves because they control the empty seats. They also set the tuition and they also just have the government loans as a total number probably years at a time. This means your cost means nothing because it is detached from any hypothetical economy they claim we have. Since that is true, the economy in America is illogical. It is so bad it is not even something that can be broken.

#### The Job

All the good ones are never yours unless you were born to have it was my experience. We funneled all of them to the Internet and now look it. A monster ate them, then we call got chained together with these links. Corporate America raised that whip on us that way these days. How foolish are we to think some one is not going to get in there and poke around? Now that you know about the possibility, does it matter if it has become that bad or not?

. . .

### Banks in America

You fuckers! This is where it gets really bad because I get to let you look at documents. I can number my comments according to a set of bank statements. The more words there the better, but know that I will use the comparison of transactions if that is a thing you all study already, cool, if not, hooray.
