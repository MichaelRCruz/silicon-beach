# The Painting

This is a painting with a tree along a river set across from the mountains and the foreground underneath the tree is a landing on the shore of a river for a boat. Two women are calling out to the mountains. The tree branches extend across the top of the painting above two objects of similar form.

The presence of the objects in the painting have a peculiar effect on the trees from the human perspective. Similar to a surveying stone a tree serves as a landmark along the river. The surveying stone has grown into the earth like the tree. The tree, unlike the stone on the opposing shore, does not vanish from gravity.

Perhaps this is the reason for the presence of the two objects of similar form. They do not grow like the tree and the rock on the other shore of the river and appear to help the tree mark a land as location.

Consider the symbiotic relationship of the trees and the objects. If the inanimate objects assist the trees by _amplifying_ the message detailing a location. Technically, the trees use  the objects of the painting as computers. This amplifies their message.

The women in the painting are calling out across the river. One is leaning against the tree. The other is resting on her knees. They have different color hair. They are wearing all white. They are wearing the same thing.

The tree, the objects of similar form, and the women all call out to the mountains.

. . .

If you look close enough, the objects have an **illusion of form** personified by he two objects standing guard of a door. They are identified by the _form_ of the object. From a distance they appear to be human. In the foreground of the painting they are near perfectly alike.

According to its silhouette, the form is projected on to the ground by light as shadow. The shadow is curved to imply sophistication. Without the presence of shadow, the projection of the object must exist some place else because you know where you are relative to the sun and how long that shadow is. Your imagination allows for the recognition of the curve that describes the form. If both projections are available in nature, by shadow and by nature, then there is always a **preference of perception**. If you could superimpose those two as a fluctuating pair, then that is our basic reality in nature, i.e., we see the same thing twice and never feel the same. An imagination, then, is the consistency we work for to feel the same way twice when we see the same thing twice. The curve your imagination makes swirls those moments onto a canvas.

Orientation arrives to its origin as echoes in the mountains from the songs of angels singing a duet at the same space & at the same moment. This light in your imagination shines a premonition into your ears when you are lost. When you are art, the light shines a premonition. Are premonitions the perspective of relativity. Is Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla _each-other_ to each other like Issac Newton & Gottfried Leibniz prior to their discoveries of the derivative & the integral.

From the perspective of the women, the painting frames you in to `a` - `down` - `right` - `select` - `left` - `start`. How many rivers flow north? To assume the river in the painting is flowing south is one bearing we have on our location. The sun projects light from the east over the river. That would imply sunrise. With that second bearing the location is revealed with the intent of the women in the painting. If they are calling for a return home, does that mean this is actually sunset? If it is sunset, then is this the Nile River? If this is the Nile River, then is this in Egypt. If this is in Egypt, then who are they? If they are, then how did they find me?
