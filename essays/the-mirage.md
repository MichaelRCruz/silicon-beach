# The Mirage

One night in Los Angeles, California I could not find fault in myself nor the reader, but the next day I began to realize that I am you and reality reached the next stratum. My friend, Emily, showed me much of Los Angeles when I first arrived and I will never forgot what she taught me about the trees. Imagine every kind of tree growing here.

If trees could be links in the shine of a filament, then one The shadows moved with the wind as I was resting in the light from the sun. They seemed like they were talking to me, but then something strange happened. I became afraid of what they could be saying and then the shadows disappeared before my eyes. Please know that if I had to define what I saw, for now it is an apparition, but was it an apparition because of what it said or because the shadows disappeared then faded to black?

The next moment brought me to my feet as no such thing pulled up a vehicle in a line of cars at a red light. On the horizon of the dessert was a woman applying lipstick or gloss to her lips that cast an image through the glass of her car window that was a reflection of light that arrived through another layer of glass rear window. I knew it probably was not a cigarette she was smoking, but I wanted her to be. This new energy has brought attention and that attention has left room in my reasoning for new ideas and considerations. In crept no such thing and that lured me into traffic to lean in only inches from the passenger door window. I tried to talk to no such thing, but when I recognized the mirage, I turned to observe the world to my left and there was a another vehicle with red and blue lights. This machine chirped a terrifying sound and began to apprehend me by the words of no such thing. I asked who these words were restraining my hands behind my back and placing me in a cell without the words of my God. The representation of the police had guns, shiny badges, and another machine parked in a way that requested compliment on its form. I fulfilled the request at gun point as I observed a holstered weapon on all four bodies of all four representations of the police. They abducted me to this place with unlocked doors and mirrors.

Their machine transported me to a concrete slab and rested in motion alongside another machine of similar form that was labeled with a shield with the initialism, "USC". This was alarming considering the machined I was locked inside did not have the namespace, Los Angeles. If those machines are there to protect and serve, then why do the machines boast this false objective? The facility of machines has one bench with a mirrored surface, cold to the touch, that was bolted to the floor, but there was no baseball game in the mirrors I was shackled between. Light bounced around me, light bounced off of me, and light bounced through me with three distractions: the foot-traffic in my peripheral visions, the reflections of the mirrored surfaces, and the questions from the refracted jailers.

The traffic of people on foot entered and exited the facility as often as the traffic of vehicles of the Los Angeles streets. As I observed the people on foot, less than one third were in uniform. One in their underwear and shoes violently commanded me to turn around and look at myself in the mirrored wall. As moments passed, I cried without tears as the jailers went through my property and separated it into containers of their chosen category. I was tricked into answering some questions of an unknown source and unknown reason when the jailer said this will go how you would like it. The proposition was that the more I cried, the worse it would get for me. I cried out of control and that action was met with their choice to transport me to a facility with stronger locks.

One night, I slept in my cell without the word of God that I desired the moment I was on my feet after the experience with the shadows, before the mirage on the horizon that led to my arrest.



I requested a bible, but was given a copy of the smallest New Testament that would only be given to me if I gave them one of the documents handed to me by one of the jailers. Because of my eyesight and the reluctance to hand over any evidence I was there, I refused the deal and went to sleep per the suggestion of the jailer. When I woke up, I talked to the ghost of Eve and cried my apology for the cell we were without and within.

I pushed the button for the electronic intercom in my cell to request the Word of God. The machine fumbled my request and brought me the same copy of the New Testament in Spanish. At that moment I learned this was a joke to them especially when they bounced me from the button to the door of the cell, back to the button, and then back to the door of the cell. Prior to all of this they fondeled my medication and promised to order me more only to forget about my dose that night.
