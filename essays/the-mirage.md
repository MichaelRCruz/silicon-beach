One night in Los Angeles, California I could not find fault in myself nor the reader, but the next day I began to realize that I am you and reality reached the next stratum. My friend, Emily, showed me much of Los Angeles when I first arrived and I will never forget what she taught me about the trees here. There seems to be every tree you could imagine. There is a church on the west of the 405 with a garden along the sidewalk. When I lived with Gavin, him and I would walk the dogs, but one day when we walked by the church, Gavin could read my expression when I saw the garden. He knew what I was thinking. It really looks like another planet compared to where I remember most. I wish it did not still feel like that.


Before I was arrested, by people in uniform claiming to be police officers, I was resting in the light of the sun and the shadows moved with the wind. They seemed like they were talking to me, but then something strange happened. The shadows disappeared before my eyes and then faded again into black. I stood up and God pulled up a vehicle in a line of cars at a red light. On the horizon of the dessert was a woman applying lipstick or gloss to her lips that cast an image through the glass of her car window that was a relection of light that arrived through another layer of glass rear window. I knew it probably was not a cigarette she was smoking, but I wanted her to be. This new energy has brought attention and that attention has left room in my reasoning for new ideas and considerations. In crept no such thing and that lured me into traffic to lean in only inches from the passenger door window. I tried to talk to no such thing, but when I recognized the mirage, I turned to observe the world to my left and there was a another vehicle with red and blue lights. This machiine chirped a terrifying sound and began to apprehend me by the words of no such thing. I asked whos words these were restraining my hands behind my back and placing me in a cell without the words of my God. The representation of the police had guns, shiny badges, and another machine parked in a way that requested compliment on its form. I fulfilled the request at gun point as I observed a holsetered weapon on the body of the four representations of the police.

They abducted me to a place that was not a police department because of the lack of authentic security of the building. The machine transported us to a concrete slab and alongside another machine that was labeled with a Los Angeles college - USC. They brought me into a facility that had one long bench with a mirrored surface that was attached to the floor. This bench could hold twelve people. Along the side of the bench was a place to tie the metal links around my wrists. This bench, sat only myself, but has two surfaces on the wall that were of the same reflective material.

There were three distractions: my reflection in the mirror, the random questions asked by the jailors resembling those a social media account would ask, and foot-traffic in the other direction. The traffic of people on foot entered and exited the facility as often as the traffic of vehicles of the Los Angeles streets. As I observed the people on foot, less than one third were in uniform. One in their underwear and shoes violently commanded me to turn around and look at myself in the mirrored wall. As moments passed, I cried without tears as the jailors went through my property and seperated it into containers of their chosen category. I was trciked into answering some questions of an unknown source and unknown reason when the jailor said this will go how you would like it. The proposition was that the more I cried, the worse it would get for me. I cried out of control and that action was met with their choice to transport me to a facility with stronger locks.

One night had passed as I slept in my cell without the word of God that I desired the moment I was on my feet after the experience with the shadows, before the mirage on the horizon that led to my arrest. I requested a bible, but was given a copy of the smallest New Testament that would only be given to me if I gave them one of the documents handed to me by one of the jailors. Because of my eyesight and the reluctance to hand over any eveidence I was there, I refused the deal and went to sleep per the suggestion of the jailor. When I woke up, I talked to the ghost of Eve and cried my apology for locking her in a cell without the light of day. These thoughts created a desire for the Word as I pushed the button for the electronic intercom in my cell to request the Word of God. The machine fumbled my request and brought me the same copy of the New Testament in Spanish. At that moment I learned this was a joke to them especially when they bounced me from the button to the door of the cell, back to the button, and then back to the door of the cell. Prior to all of this they fondeled my medication and promised to order me more only to forget about my dose that night.
