The first thing you will have to understand is the eye of the wind.

Imagine a clock. It has twelve numbers that help us remember where we are at any given time, but instead of measuring time, we are interested in measuring the two-dimensional space that surrounds our boat. Try to make the clock large enough so that the numbers sit at the edge of the Earth's horizon equidistant from each other dividing the circumference of the Earth. With this in mind, you are better able to understand the wind. It will always blow from a particular direction and where that wind is coming from is twelve o'clock. This means your wind-clock will always be rotating clockwise or counterclockwise as the wind changes direction.

Now that you have a way to orientate yourself with the changing wind, your objective is to remain constant. There is an appreciation or wonder you might gain from contemplating the relationship of these two efforts. The elements at sea may seem random, meaningless, or spiteful, but your efforts as a skipper and the complexities of the ship's engineering are there for you when need them.
