# Draw What You See

The first time I witnessed my bank account, C-Money, give a subtle and false account on my behalf was during the days of these therapy sessions we went to as a child and also when a psychologist asked me to, "draw what I see".

. . .

The magazine, _Highlights_ was the best part of those visits to the psychologist. That is where I learned of that children's magazine and when I asked my parents for a subscription. They were delivered to our house in the new city we lived in. Greenfield is a suburb that was conveniently located between two highways: 27th Street and 76th Street. We lived on Allerton Avenue in a three-bedroom house that had a detached garage, but a garage none-the-less. The driveway was pretty large, but that was because the garage was built further into the lot from the street. There was this place we called "the field" that my friends and I explored. Years later, the city needed a place to deposit the earth they excavated from the construction project of Coldspring Rd.. So, the field became _not_ the field and we called it "the hill" instead. On Allerton Avenue was our mailbox, and for a summer, I enthusiastically waited for those magazines to arrive. It is difficult to say why I liked them so much, but there was just a unique quality about them. Why did they call their publication _Highlights_?

One particular author I read in middle school was R.L. Stine - my favorite author then. I loved waiting for the next one to publish. They were so well-written and there has not been another series of books I could enjoy more. The smell of those pages will remain in memory forever. As an adult, I do not often seek out scary stories, but the mystery of them is what inspired my imagination and taught me surprising things. The interaction of two characters in that book led to an interest in chess and the way Stine described the houses and neighborhoods brought a certain mood that became the foundation of wonder when I admire the houses I see in real life. One story starts with a brother and a sister playing chess. The main character's thoughts about how long her game of chess lasted with her brother, that night, was very meaningful to me. There were only a few words used to describe that emotion, but in a way that was unforgettable. R.L. Stine's craft helped reveal something about life that made me who I am today. It gives me goosebumps just thinking about it.

. . .

There are only two things I remember about those sessions with that child psychologist: playing chess and drawing five three-dimensional cubes on paper. If you still have that drawing, please may I have it back? It was just annoying to not know, my whole life, what that was all about. Since I am here now, in this rooming house, I guess I should tell you that I did not _draw what I see[n]_. Their prompt went like this.

Lay back, close your eyes and picture you are at the edge of a cliff (maybe a mountain or a plateau or a balcony or a cloud). You are still in your chair. Your eyes are closed. At the top of the mountain you grow wings and begin to fly. You make it to your destination, but after you finish tripping out about this new superpower of yours, and people are not as weird to you in public anymore, the castle in front of you is intriguing enough to go in. In through the out door you go, or out through the in door if that is what you are in to. Inside the castle there are some doors. Hopefully, you pick one, or you arrive at one, or you still find the door despite a momentary lapse of. You open the door. Draw what you see.

I had to improvise here because I opened the door and it was just an empty room. There were walls of brick and a window with bars. Instead I chose the other way and drew what was in my imagination instead. The door I opened led me outside and there was no box or room.

Here arrive the goosebumps. With the door now behind me, the outside was sunny. In my drawing, there was a tree and maybe a squirrel I drew for effect. I also drew five three-dimensional boxes floating in the air. The psychologist asked what they represented and I said they were my family people. These are the ones I often call my bank accounts for fun and also out of necessity. It made sense to me because the number of boxes added up to the same number of family people I could think of. The drawing happened. We talked about it, but I did not expect him to ask me what the boxes represented. That reasoning was improvised in the moment. I drew the boxes because it was art that I desired more than what his story prompt led me to depict in my mind. That art was all in the moment.

As a thought experiment, pretend that my drawing of those five boxes was the center of my reality, or some dimension, or the consciousness of my existence. Time for us has always been linear and imagined to follow a line that you can follow in one direction. To remember, in this paradigm, is to follow that same line in the other direction. We can call that an index of moments. If I wanted to describe this other way of thinking, the index is still an index, but not linear. The collection of all the moments in your life are like a tessellation that shapes your existence.

To conceptualize this _other_ way of time, you will need a point of reference in that tessellation. Pick any moment in your life as the center. Each and every moment that you are able to recall the center is a subset of the full set of all moments of your life. Each and every moment that you cannot recall this moment accumulates towards a subset that exists inside the center. This is a very loose and brief description of the concept because recollection is mysterious in that your emotions and intuition seem to have significant influence on the ability to remember.

The process of accumulation depends on recollection and the experiences you gain. Consider the attempts you have made to recall a phone number or the title of a film. Often, we forget one day and the other we remember. The connection we seem to have as humans also influence our memories. We may forget or lose interest in certain hobbies because of a new job or the next love you find shows you something else about yourself that can influence the accumulation of your moments that shape our temporal existence on Earth. Imagine this in heaven? Would you find absolute tessellated completion with God? How much does our imagination add to these shapes? How much would misinformation subtract from these shapes? Would this encourage you to maintain the source of truth?

My art teacher in high school had a curriculum and, as far as I know, the standard for building that set of instructions is challenging because it was not until I asked her how to draw well that she was able to teach me one of the most valuable lessons of my life. She just said, "draw what you see". That wisdom was what allowed me to look closer at the scenes in nature, the emotions of others, and the things in life that I desired to record for myself with charcoal and paper.

My friend on the train to Chicago, shortly after that earthquake by the airport, gave me a book. The title was _How to Draw What You See_. We never met before those moments in the observation car of the train, but he also asked me something else I will never forget. It was a peculiar question, but also one that was very innocent and simple. What is your favorite word? I recall that scene in Donnie Darko when Drew Barrymore played a high school teacher. On the board was a drawing, also in chalk, and the drawing had the words, cellar door, written in English. The way it sounded, she said, was where she found beauty. That movie stayed with me and now I understand why. My response to that question in the observation car was, catharsis.

That is my favorite word, but the way I made that selection was not out of two choices. The selection was out of a multitude and the choice to have a favorite word is still paired with the other choice of not having one at all. The process of selection was different for Drew and I. She found beauty in the sound of the language and I found beauty in its meaning. There is one consideration to make here. Did William Shakespeare get too far ahead of himself when he asked, what's in a name? Was this the reason for that scene in Donnie Darko?

For your ~~consideration~~ pleasure I wrote a poem inspired by Drew Barrymore, the character she played in Donnie Darko, and for the film's writer, Richard Kelley.
