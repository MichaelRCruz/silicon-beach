# The Lifespan of a Language

Pretend you fully understand the measurement that you might observe from literally anything. To slice it into only two abstractions is a luxury of choice. Your space is divided evenly or or unevenly, but to have consideration for nothing requires division. This should support the theories of discreet math and the like. If this brings an answer for division that is always asked about. Maybe the reason is not that you cannot divide by zero, but rather you have to divide.

Since the description of something that closely resembles discrete math is the road to suggesting there are dead ends in these maps of trajectory that all originate from the center of a sphere. After all the hits ever in every game of baseball could carve this normalized center of Earth, then to allow the hits to bounce off the boundaries of the cube. The area you find in this distance of space will have another rule. The upward trajectory lets us remove the possibility that the surface of the ballpark has only one moment to be removed and that is after lift off. The cool thing about that is that this will do is make your math easier.

The collisions though is where people fall in love.
