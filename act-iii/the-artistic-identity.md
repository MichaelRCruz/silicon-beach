# The Artistic Identity

> If two angels sing a song in the same moment, then the artistic identity of man would be a message across a river and over the walls in the mountains slaying ears to hear distinction in sound during another moment in space.

This be real, but the other way in the same time.

If the language of discrete math provides clarity, then a cute way to say this would be to say it explains everything. To have never studied this kind of math is unfortunate, but look at its nature. Are there infinite places of rest or is there a countdown? What are those moments tessellating lift off? A number system with infinitely divisible spaces has _PI_, and _e_, and _i_. If these locations, rather than anything else, could describe the area of a circle, then what can they tell us about our identities?

How could we consider of the idea to leave for any other planet if we cannot maintain a source of truth here on Earth? Imagine space travel. Would you trust _anything_ you heard from home? What guarantee is it that the math behind our signals are is sound?

If song could be copied and autonomously created by machine, where is the human identification? Do our artificially intelligent friends have a vibe? What does their music sound like? Could we find a signature to go along with our signals. Does the universe require certificates of authority? What if we started using one, just in case?

This be real, but the other way in the same time.

So for all of history with everyone alive know these words to be a center. The words you are reading now are have reached everybody reading this now. They are much like your own. There appears to be a comparative available for fun regarding consistency or by some extension, certainty. If the moon does not appear to have an absolute nature, then does it by your word? Does this imply that time is the square roots we plow. Mine was a carrot? Am I gay now? Is that not a sincere question because of the snowmen joke? This directly prefaces the story untold.

Writing this in one paragraph is boring, but I will try. If our art has an identity then the quickest way to show this is in difference and always something else.

One sentence is not bad, but that is also just a jk tossed into the wire like a read receipt. Would that be like flying a kite? If there is wind enough of an excuse to tie a string to a metal key and, though the wire, the auto tiller of your mind that will see other strings. They are on your sail for something that distraction does the best job to describe a a new moment, but still lacks a complete definition. The Dictionary is safe because we can just call the distraction love because what else could be leading your faith?

How many much can you draw from an idea? How easy is it to resist the obvious favoritism in the space other than the location of your preference? The idea here is that you, myself, nor the reader will see the distraction. What about the fishing pole? Aside from what is fished, is the sea not glimmering an infinite amount of chimes of light that are infinitely different from an infinite number of spaces? This should suggest that the absurdity in expecting anything outside the space of the artistic identity is one and two is found in now turning to see the remainder. What is outside the artistic identity other than the way you will describe them to each other? What if the idea of the last question was only possible by the game of catch or something digital like two mirrors in attention of each other.

If we cannot draw a blank on paper, then is the blank you are drawing in your mind just like mine at the moment. I feel like Forrest Gump right now when he just decided to stop running all over the place. May I suggest that the, lol, has something to be said about its similarity of the same moment that measured a marathon?

lol, can be the word to represent the arbitrary decision you will make that that is something only found within beauty. Moving to discredit the notion of chance, will be in two acts, then.

Your measurement or estimated location of the center of a spinning top will have no opposite because a true opposite would leave most dualities at rest. Does this seem to suggest that the force of entropy would be like hitting a baseball twice because you could use the initial momentum of your swing help you around to catch the bat to put a second spin on the ball. What are sabermetrics with that new look?

For one ballpark only, take the distance hit by every ball and linear regression will draw a line of best fit in a circle. For those that know about it, my question is if you can say the identity of baseball could be to superimpose those 32 circles. The way that a graphic interchange format, GIG, will show is a movement in space between the curves must say something. A lens to find that pattern is the effect the spin of the Earth may have on some kind of distribution of those numbers. Finally, the return to the original shape is almost like a stethoscope for the Earth. Is baseball now back to being the time keeper? What did the comparison with the pitching clock. If it regresses to zero, then who's ass do I have to kick? What if the pitching clock neutralized the effect time has on the earth that might encourage regression. If fact, would the circle not actually be a sphere. Do not forget to normalize the data so that home plate is the center of the Earth. That way you can skip the 32 teams and use all of them. Did it regress to no movement when you only took all hits following the introduction of the pitching clock?

If there is meaning in the comparison normalized on Earth to one park at home, then what does that pyramid look like for all 32 parks again? What if the pyramid was better as a  square because the choice of any location on earth might requires home plate to be normalized to your location? You can serialize this with a complication of four or more locations, and even further when that movement is understood. This is infinitely bound. Entropy in this model is the cube we wrap around Earth. There then are six locations on Earth, at any given time, that cannot have a ballpark. This is because Earth inside of the best fitting jeans it can find that just happens to be a perfect cube. The theory of wobble has north and true north to make up for his friend. So, they friends. Anyways these are a pair of yoga pants, those jeans from before are now yoga pants. Just imagine the ones that Earth wears. A perfect cube would be the key to that consideration. The six areas carved out is something worth communicating in art.
