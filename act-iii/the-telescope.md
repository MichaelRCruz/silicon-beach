# The Telescope

Your telescope is fun to look at too.

Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by an _idea of_ or this _notion of_ understanding that says you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could say that this is as close as it gets. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all.

Rather than advice, how about something nice to hear? How nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this moment if it was not for every moment that happened until this moment. What path did you take through the tessellation? What were the colors you saw?

### Lenses Fewer Than or Equal to, n

The interpretation of figure 4 demonstrates romance. With two lamps, you and I would be looking at only each others eyes. The light shuffles as the two wheels freely turn. The two simplest examples are little telescopes, but side-by-side like our binocular vision. How much could you learn from a glance? The answer is the number of lenses you have layered. Like the two in the illustration, there are lenses on your telescope. The colors of the map will influence the light that shines through the paper, but also something else.

There are nine ways to roll your telescope with that map with the perforated edge. Try one, but make sure it looks nice, but remember you can only use the seal once. You probably want to find the lenses you like first. Could you give yourself you own eye examination? If yes, then that is what you will need to do. After the seal is in place, the domains of light is locked in place. The range you will yield is measured by the dial at the end of the telescope that has part of the paper sticking up. The seal you have should make yours look like a paper sail. Lastly, the telescope will twist like a hotel ink pen that have a limit each direction you twist. Those two limits are the limits of the _range of speculation_ on your telescope.

The mnemonic, _fewer_ than or equal to n ought to help figure that out. You will also soon figure out the limitations of the relationships of like patterns. In all your calculations, do not forget the map could be rolled the other way too.


When out at sea you might begin to feel lonely. If you need a friend, do not worry about answering a question here and there out there at sea. When you have a chance not to panic if something went wrong. Say, for instance, you had a soccer ball and named it something and they fell overboard, then what would you do? That is what you should worry about instead. That is why I am describing the _figure-eight maneuver_ in a set of pictures I made for you. There are five of them, but you can only look at each one by itself and never two at the same time. Make sure not to get that confused with the lenses and that _range of speculation_. Never two or more of the five, for now.


### Range of Speculation

I propose we stop interviewing people and expect this result in figure 1.


```javascript
// return the missing value of an array
let arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9];
function hello(arr) {
  n = arr[arr.length - 1];
  let value = arr.reduce((a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  })
  return (((n*(n + 1))/2) - 1) - value;
}
hello(arr);
```

If you tune you telescope with the correct parameters, then that's it.

### Beta Test

Hold your telescope at eye level, but about an arms-length, or less. Make sure you can see everything else safely. Once you find the best orientation with your eyes, both of them if you can. This display in your field-of-vision now makes you the first cyborg on your own planet! The technology you are wielding is enough to make you dangerous. The difference in hue, from the telescope's perspective is different, but if you maneuver through the eye-of-the-wind, then you have to maneuver with your telescope, or do we? What if you could adjust the scope to see things clearer or find the perfect frequency on an AM radio.

How do those new frames fit? Are they tight in the ears? I can always adjust them for you if you would like. Stop in any time? What is time, though?
