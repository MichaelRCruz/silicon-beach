# The Telescope

Your telescope is fun to look at too.

Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by an _idea of_ or this _notion of_ understanding that says you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could say that this is as close as it gets. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all.

Rather than advice, how about something nice to hear? How nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this moment if it was not for every moment that happened until this moment. What path did you take through the tessellation? What were the colors you saw?

###### Title
#
Telescopic Apple Salad
###### Description
> Human meal. Serves two.
###### Ingredients
*
one map

*
one seal

*
one star

###### Steps
n. roll map with reflective side inwards and contain with seal

n. detract the scope by turning clockwise in all directions

n. position the scope at eye-level to observe the projection

n. line the scope parallel with the horizon for aim

n. imagine your absorption of sun light by contrast of hue

### Actual Perception

You should practice while you can before you see land on the horizon. The last map in the back of your atlas is your telescope - the only page with the perforated edge. The lens you have is now a a mosaic of static colors. Looking carefully for patterns grants the perspectives.

Have you ever saw a pile of scrolls in a cartoon or just one scroll on a pedestal? They bulge off to the side with some kind of seal towards the center.
