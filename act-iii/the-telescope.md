Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by an _idea of_ or this _notion of_ understanding that says you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could say that this is as close as it gets. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all.

Rather than advice, how about something nice to hear? How nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this moment if it was not for every moment that happened until this moment. What path did you take through the tessellation? What were the colors you saw?

### Lenses Fewer Than or Equal to, n

The interpretation of figure 4 demonstrates romance. With two lamps, you and I would be looking at only each others eyes. The light shuffles as the two wheels freely turn. The two simplest examples are little telescopes, but side-by-side like our binocular vision. How much could you learn from a glance? The answer is the number of lenses you have layered. Like the two in the illustration, there are lenses on your telescope. The colors of the map will influence the light that shines through the paper, but also something else.

There are nine ways to roll your telescope with that map with the perforated edge. Try one, but make sure it looks nice, but remember you can only use the seal once. You probably want to find the lenses you like first. Could you give yourself you own eye examination? If yes, then that is what you will need to do. After the seal is in place, the domains of light is locked in place. The range you will yield is measured by the dial at the end of the telescope that has part of the paper sticking up. The seal you have should make yours look like a paper sail. Lastly, the telescope will twist like a hotel ink pen that have a limit each direction you twist. Those two limits are the limits of the _range of speculation_ on your telescope.

The mnemonic, _fewer_ than or equal to n ought to help figure that out. You will also soon figure out the limitations of the relationships of like patterns. In all your calculations, do not forget the map could be rolled the other way too.


When out at sea you might begin to feel lonely. If you need a friend, do not worry about answering a question here and there out there at sea. When you have a chance not to panic if something went wrong. Say, for instance, you had a soccer ball and named it something and they fell overboard, then what would you do? That is what you should worry about instead. That is why I am describing the _figure-eight maneuver_ in a set of pictures I made for you. There are five of them, but you can only look at each one by itself and never two at the same time. Make sure not to get that confused with the lenses and that _range of speculation_. Never two or more of the five, for now.


### Range of Speculation

I propose we stop interviewing people and expect this result in figure 1.


```javascript
// return the missing value of an array
let arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9];
function hello(arr) {
  n = arr[arr.length - 1];
  let value = arr.reduce((a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  })
  return (((n*(n + 1))/2) - 1) - value;
}
hello(arr);
```

If you tune you telescope with the correct parameters, then that's it.

### Beta Test

Hold your telescope at eye level, but about an arms-length, or less. Make sure you can see everything else safely. Once you find the best orientation with your eyes, both of them if you can. This display in your field-of-vision now makes you the first cyborg on your own planet! The technology you are wielding is enough to make you dangerous. The difference in hue, from the telescope's perspective is different, but if you maneuver through the eye-of-the-wind, then you have to maneuver with your telescope, or do we? What if you could adjust the scope to see things clearer or find the perfect frequency on an AM radio.

How do those new frames fit? Are they tight in the ears? I can always adjust them for you if you would like. Stop in any time? What is time, though?

### The Gift Horse

If you are riding a horse a you begin to imagine galloping through an open field after you experienced something spooky in normal forest because if you say _enchanted_ forest, then no one will believe you. A sudden valley appears, but the surface has concavity hyperbolic in nature or is it the other way? The profile of the image on the little telescopes, that resemble a marching bad, looks like spinning wheels that would behave like Interstate I-90.

If you open you atlas to the appendix, or index, or page 205 in Essential Calculus, authored by James Stewart, The Riemann Sum appears to be the place to begin again with the fundamentals of calculus. For myself, calculus has been the greatest discovery and favorite human endeavor. This goes for the language's utility of practical functionality. The stories of its origin resembles the laws of nature in the light of the _or_ world.

As you glide down the slope of that mountain you begin to wonder if you could run as fast one day, but then you realize the friction involved. We can forget about that until we talk about traveling the speed of light without rocket fuel. Gravity is _very_ special to you on this mountain or the boat you are sailing this moment. If I could describe, then the preference is with sailing.

### The Mechanics of Time Travel

Gravity is special. It is so special that if we put your mom in outer space, she would orbit, but then the boyfriend giant would have to deal with that and, yeah. That's it.

For real, though. Space ships, airplanes, and your car all rely on gravity just like your sailboat. A racecar around the turn has to follow the God limit otherwise the driver dies. Space ships cannot ship if it was not for gravity. Yikes, could you imagine how a sailboat might use gravity?

Gravity does all the heavy lifting for you on your way with no direction home directory. When the wind is blowing from the twelve o'clock direction on your wind-clock, your bow should be poiinted at two o'clock. This is a nice place to be if you can handle it when the wind intensifies. The key on your map will describe the zig-zag pattern along your route to your destination.

### The Zig-Zag Pattern

Paired zs adequately superimposed with caps lock or not. Either way I win.

figure 2
Wind always originating from twelve o'clock.

|10|wind|2|
|-|:-:|-|
||v|/||
|\\|v|||
||v|/||

The alternating two o'clock and ten o'clock positions of the bow of your ship will bring you to an origin if and only if the wind does not shift nor any shift along the course you're headed. Maintain a bearing that is held at your twelve o'clock position. If not, then the zig-zag pattern will be meaningless unless it is amplified. Remember move the tiller starboard or port depending on the side of the boat that is lowest above water when your sail is full of wind.

### Another Beta Test

Get familar with the feel of the tiller. Listen to the vibration with your hands and let go of the tiller only to grab it again to learn the orientation the boat _wants_ to be in. Your bow will tell you the direction that it wants. When your tiller is parallel with the length of the, ship with the bow following nothing with you at the stern sitting high-side. High-side is port at two o'clock and high-side is starboard at 10 o'clock of the wind.

### The Turntables

The profile of the spinning wheel is actually just two turn tables. The gravity of both record players allows the vinyl to rest on their respective mats. The one up-side down has gravity in the other direction. When you are sailing, the wind that fills your sails is countered by the weight hanging off the bottom of your boat. If you swim underneath the boat, it is large enough to hug it like a bear. Give it a kiss for me while you are down there because that is your engine and if you could call the wind fuel, then call me. The weight of the keel falls with gravity as the sailboat tilts with the wind. The fulcrum is the water of the sea.

When you are sailing, imagine being the needle on one of the turntables along a track of the vinyl that spins the same direction of the other turn table or it spins the same direction. One is upside-down. Once you finish your track, the vinyl goes back in the sleeve, but have now scooped into the ice cream cone that became one when the record player fell off it. If you look inside the ice cream cone, there you are. Were you not just in my kitchen admiring my clock?

To dream within in a dream is much like the laws of physics. There are Russian Dolls everywhere and I mean the full stack kind. A more poetic description can be the concentric circles when you drop your cell phone in the water. What if you dropped your friend in the water? What would you do? What is their favorite record?


### The Figure Eight Maneuver

If your friend falls off the boat or you dropped your cell phone in the sea, then the figure-eight maneuver will be crucial to its survival. With your sailing position at two o'clock, if you "let off" the tiller when sitting high-side, then the bow of the ship will want to turn towrds irons. This is the direction of the wind. That is to say, an mored boat with flaked sails will point into the wind. Since you have hoisted your main sail with the main sheet, the thing dangling in front of you called the block, will absorb half the energy you would without the help of all the blocks on your boat. Some people do not think physics be like it is, but it do.

### The Painting

If the painting could ask for a feeling calling you to reflect the lights beyond the moments of nostalgia during the yearly moments before death, then there is a landscape painting of five three-dimensional objects like the one I drew one day when I used my imagination. The depth of this painting, in presentation of my own, have similarities discussed in this essay.

Human intervention will appear antagonistic, like the moon, if you are not careful suggesting there is a heavenly presentation of two and the worldly appeal of choice. This deterministic luxuries of choice are evidenced by the human _condition_ that is more appropriately described as a human _process_. These words are tasked to reveal a more suitable perspective of life. In light of the contrast between the definitive human _process_ to the definitive human _condition_, I hope this hypothetical lesson pleases God. Our faith handles the rest. The _locations_ of similar interest of the elements on Earth appear to the result of intent rather than entropy.

#### Perspective

##### The Painting's Foreground

Unlike the other known pairs, the objects have no distinguishable characteristics between them.

The presence of the objects in the painting have a peculiar effect on the trees from the human perspective. Similar to a surveying stone a tree serves as a landmark along the river. The surveying stone has grown into the earth like the tree. The tree, unlike the stone on the opposing shore, does not vanish from gravity.

Perhaps this is the reason for the presence of the two objects of similar form. They do not grow like the tree and the rock on the other shore of the river and appear to help the tree mark a land as location.

Do the two objects reveal an insufficiency of the tree by virtue of the role of the objects. If not, then are the identical roles of the tree and the objects better understood in perspective of comparative form. To that end, consider the symbiotic relationship of the trees and the objects. If the inanimate objects assist the trees by _amplifying_ the message detailing a location. Technically, the trees use computers if the objects of the painting contribute to the amplified message.

The objects of identical form also provide utility to the river The sophistication of them is exemplified by their paired state as the two, with a distance, can represent two points in space connected by a line. If the river is a line, then the paired state of the objects suggest that they complete the first step in the process of form. The important realization is that they have completed this step as a pair and are inanimate.

The personification of the objects have an illusiion if you look close enough. In that orientation, the two objects stand like guards locking a door. The door is for a ship sailing in the mountains across the river. The personification of the objects is the curavature of the object's silouete projected into your imagination by God and projected on to the ground by light. One may be observed with your eyes, the other allows you to observe with your imagination. Of those two choices, the preference for imaginative reasoning is revealed.

This foreground represents amplification of a signal from home. The curves of the women and their body language sing. The song they sing is a reflection of human sophistication. The melodies in their song emote feelings of a species only found at this location. The orchestra of the human endeavor is painted on the same trajectory as the aplified message broadcasted from the first chairs of silicon and carbon. They all shelter under the wisdom of tessellated branches.

The colors in perspective via illumination in light give presentation to the three opticall illusions that I know of. The first two are opositoinal forms and shapes in illuminaiton from a horizontal light source. The dark side of the moon & the light side of the moon are the first two optical illusions. The third is shadow. If the moon were singing for you under that tree and on your sailboat because you cannot listen to music on your phone, then I got you, but check this out. The moon only has one of its optical illusions exposed to us because it is, supposedly, locked in orbit. If that is true, then I have shown two things that I have learned today. First, the moon is an emodiment of worldly illusion. Second, if giant boyfriend was only showing one of his optical illuisions, does that mean he is hiding the only way he knows how or since he does not use the other two optical illusions of mother nature and father time, he then should be considered efficient since the other two domains just need to wake up. When your eyes follow the depths of the lines of the perspective of distance, the seams are carefully lined like lipstick. The stone against the water and itself, the object and the water, the woman and the shadow, and the Earth and the sky.

The color of the leaves suggest more about location. If this is true then the message is further amplified by the tree. Adfditionally, the nature of the leaves, compared to the snow on top of the mountainis in the backgroud suggest a worldly proximatey often found in an arid climate. Since the color of the leaves suggest this, then the scope must be dialwed out if there is a desire to continue. The color of the leaves, in their shared color scheme within that space of the painting, speaks of a moment much more sacred than any found with nostalgia. If nostalgia was not the right word if the moment was not now, then what word? Timeless.

Lastly, the perspectibes in presentation with the object was a reminder of the spiritual perspective like that one time when my boat capsized in the Pacific Ocean. Before reading about that, the mountains in the background reveal more perspectives of illusion.


##### The Background

Orientation has echoes in the moutains from the songs of amgeles singing a duet in the same space & in the same moment. The light shines a premonition when you are lost. When you are art, the light shines a perspective of relativety & shines a perspective of location. If the perspectives of light relative to the other natural phenomonons like gravity & like sound. Would a mountain be a space of perspecive if the foothills across the river could amplify a song over the mountain wall? The songs of angeles would be echoed by stone and valleys. What would this echo sound like in your rocky space of perspective? What if the echo could be identified even inside an opposing space to the foreground of the painting. If two angels sing a song in the same moment, then the artistic identity of man would be a message across a river and over the walls in the mountains slaying ears to hear distinction in sound during another moment in space.




### The Shadow Illusion

The shadow cast by the object is one-to-one according to the height of its shadow along the ground. What does that say about the shadow cast by you?

##### The Amplification

Do the angels of amplification sing a duet? If two spaces caannot occupy the same space at the same time, then cuold they sing a duet occupy the same space at the same moment?
