# The Telescope

Your telescope is fun to look at too.

Last night I was feeling plenty of inspiration. Most of the time, in some weird way probably, there is always an obstacle. To think anything is unfair can be managed by an _idea of_ or this _notion of_ understanding that says you already won the war. More specifically, would it sound better if you, then, could say that this is as close as it gets. The best advice I gave myself was not that everything worth having in life requires hard work. Maybe this is not advice at all.

Rather than advice, how about something nice to hear? How nice does it feel when you can say that there is no way you would have arrived to this moment if it was not for every moment that happened until this moment. What path did you take through the tessellation? What were the colors you saw?
