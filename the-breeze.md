# The Breeze

Why do we have memories of ourselves from a distance?

We had an activity in kindergarten where we all sat in a circle and passed around something like a brown paper lunch bag. The items inside had different textures, but the fun was that you were not supposed to know what the thing was until everybody had a chance to reach inside the bag to check it out. The idea was to get creeped out, I guess, in a playful way. Thinking about this now, I try to imagine being the teacher and choosing the items. They were supposed to be common household items around the house, but here is where I actually get creeped out. What kind of texture would creep you out the most if you did not know what it was before touching it? The only thing I can think of is something slimy. What other types of harmless things of texture could you find to build up a such a suspense?

This was a grade school on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is where I grew up. There are a few other peculiar moments about Clement Avenue Elementary that did were forgotten until now, but many of them are still unclear. That Halloween thing we did, as children, just seems very creepy to me because it was not my kindergarten teacher that led the activity. It was a younger lady that has us all sit in that circle one day, and as we all were settling in, she turned off the lights in the classroom.

That day was the first time I saw myself outside my self. She turned off the lights to, perhaps, evoke some Halloween vibe, but it was the first time I was ever scared. I was two perspectives in that moment as if a ghost lifted out of my body. I watched from above as they passed around that paper bag, but the escape warped my peripheral vision as my ghost kept watch. The movement, the reverse, and the ascent.
