# The Breeze

Why do we have memories of ourselves from a distance?

We had an activity in kindergarten where we all sat in a circle and passed around something like a brown paper lunch bag. The items inside had different textures, but the fun was that you were not supposed to know what the thing was until everybody had a chance to reach inside the bag to check it out. The idea was to get creeped out, I guess, in a playful way. Thinking about this now, I try to imagine being the teacher and choosing the items. They were supposed to be common household items around the house, but here is where I actually get creeped out. What kind of texture would creep you out the most if you did not know what it was before touching it? The only thing I can think of is something slimy. What other types of harmless things of texture could you find to build up a such a suspense?

This was a grade school on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is where I grew up. There are a few other peculiar moments about Clement Avenue Elementary that did were forgotten until now, but many of them are still unclear. That Halloween thing we did, as children, just seems very creepy to me because it was not my kindergarten teacher that led the activity. It was a younger lady that has us all sit in that circle one day, and as we all were settling in, she turned off the lights in the classroom.

That day was the first time I saw myself outside my self. She turned off the lights to, perhaps, evoke some Halloween vibe, but it was the first time I was ever scared. I was two perspectives in that moment as if a ghost lifted out of my body. I watched from above as they passed around that paper bag, but the escape warped my peripheral vision as my ghost kept watch. The movement, the reverse, and the ascent.

Clement Avenue was my school up until, and including, the second grade. We played kickball at recess and the multiplication and division I was doing in kindergarten sort of kicked me off into that tangent apart from the other students. Regarding the peculiarities of my childhood included the windmill, the other schools in close proximity of each other, and the overwhelming emotion I would feel in moments unexpected.

Before your first day of school in kindergarten, I can only imagine there is plenty of preparation for that day, but for myself, it was very hurried. We were late that day and I can recall the anxiety the day before. There was not much thought put into that memory nor is there much to add to that, but for some reason, it just seems mysterious. In an effort to find meaning in that, my memory has a beginning. That duplex on Howard Avenue is when my life started for me here in this world until Ramon, my supposed dad at the time, casually pointed out the apartment we lived in before then.

The place where I apparently lived as a baby is somewhere in the St. Francis area of Milwaukee near Morgan Triangle park. It had a Cousin's Subs located underneath. Ramon was a flooring and carpet installation professional that was contracting with Sherwin Williams at the time. The idea that a paint wholesaler was in the carpet installation business was not that strange then. I mean, I asked why, but maybe it was because this was prior to 2008 before the economy crashed and people had all sorts of money to spend on their investment properties. There we were, installing carpet. Him and I worked on many apartments throughout that city, but one day we just coincidentally were assigned a job to replace the flooring in that apartment building.

He was excited to tell me about it, but this type of excitement brought no new knowledge nor revealed anything about my life before the place on Howard Ave. When he mentioned this, I asked plenty of questions as I usually do, but that was all to learn that day. He just wanted me to know, I guess. Have you ever walked into a vacant room, or a vacant house, or a vacant place where someone lived, but felt something the moment you entered? Maybe it is a vibe, or maybe the way the place looks, or maybe some abstraction of Feng Shui. In any regard, there was some subtlety there that satisfied my intuition, as I was in that building that allowed me to believe him. The impression stayed with me the entire ride home. My intuition was starting to tell me more about my life and where I was from, but was I listening close enough? Was I ready to know?
