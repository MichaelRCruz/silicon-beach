# What's in an ask?

How to sail. How to write. How to draw. All three require two people and something to share, like a baseball. The idea is to play _catch_, but the fun is to pass the ball with trusting intent. The ball returns to you in the form of admiration, validity, and spirit. These moments show you that you can give and receive and need not ask for the ball.

> What's in an ask?

The _ask_ has three letters. How inconceivable is this word that occupies a small space in print, but is found in almost every moment in life? If baseball can facilitate observation, then ask someone to play _catch_.

Cazzie David authored a book. Her book has a title. Does a title name a book? Can a name title a story? Can a story be a life? Is a _life untold_ anything lived at all? I hope to share my thoughts with the you, and maybe the reader, about how much I have learned from your book, _No One Asked For This_.

First, consider the interface of [regular expressions](silicon-beach/regular-expression.md) found in my document, regular-expressions.md. This brute force approach does not really prove much, but the illustration attempts to explore the scope of your book's title as an abstracted statement of observation iterated through the loops of the English language. The conclusion I hope to share is the accuracy and balance you found in your art.
